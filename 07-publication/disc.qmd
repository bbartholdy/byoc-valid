<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->
In this study we present a [long-term] oral biofilm model with mineralisation
to produce model dental calculus. The aim of the model is to address
a variety of research questions related to dental calculus, both in the present
and in the past.
We also assess the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus.

used metagenomic classification and FTIR to  in bacterial and mineral content.
The performance of our model as a proxy for dental calculus was evaluated
using metagenomic screening for bacterial composition, and FTIR for mineral 
structure.

While our model is not an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to have outcompeted
aerobes and facultative anaerobes over the course of the experiment. This may
be a result of biofilm microenvironments, where species can produce favourable
environments within biofilms<!--cite-->.

<!-- FTIR discussion-->
Experimental samples are indicative of biofilm growth and maturation, including
mineralisation, represented by a reduction in proteins and lipids (1460, 1420, 870)
and the increasing intensity of peaks related to carbonated hydroxyapatite (1040,
600-550 cm$^{-1}$) over the course of the experiment.

The presence of collagen in dental calculus (and saliva) is still not clear. It
may be a result of external contamination [@mackiePreservationMetaproteome2017]
or end-products
of collagen degradation (e.g. carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, ICTP)
which may or may not be related to periodontitis
[@gursoySalivaryCollagen2013]. It is more likely that the proline-rich proteins
(secondary amine) present in the samples are attributed to the biofilm
matrix.

The artificial samples from day 24 resemble both the modern reference samples and
the archaeological sample in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper
slope of the archaeological sample may suggest larger crystals, which is to be
expected, as the inorganic crystals expand into the space left by degrading
organic matter over time [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010]. More samples are
needed to see if this is consistent in archaeological samples.
Overall, the spectra of the artificial calculus show an increase in the
inorganic component and a decrease in the organic component over time.
The grinding curves for days 16, 20, and 24 were very similar, suggesting
that the CPMU solution (introduced on day 16) may not have much of an effect.

Research relating to $alpha$-amylase activity and its effect on the oral biome
(whether dietary or otherwise) requires addition of amylase to the microcosm, as
it is not present in the naturally in the system (as shown in <!--cite starch paper-->). The reason for the absence of $alpha$-amylase is not clear...
There is of course no renewable source for $alpha$-amylase once the inoculations
have been completed; furthermore, there does not seem to be any retention of $alpha$-amylase
by amylase-binding streptococci (ABS).
ABS are present in the system, but do not seem to be binding amylase. At this point
we are unable to explain why. 
<!-- Is it possible that the mixture of sucrose in the starch solutions eliminates the need to feed on starch? -->

<!-- dominance of aerobes may affect interpretation of dietary studies 
Although samples were quite consitent within the experiment-->

<!-- BacDive limited info - more than 50% missing oxygen tolerance info-->

<!-- modern calculus references samples were all from the same geographic origin -->

Single donor may have affected diversity of model. Donated saliva had a lower mean
alpha-diversity than other saliva samples.

<!-- CPMU was mixed under sterile conditions, but the solution itself was not
sterilised (not sure if it can be), so may have introduced contamination. None of the
post-CPMU (day 14+) medium samples made it past authentication -->

<!-- limitations of FTIR and DNA analysis for validation of the model. -->

<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->

This method can be used for a wide range of methods-testing (e.g. DNA, proteomics, etc.) 
as well as training for various sampling methods, and contamination protocol testing.
The model also has dietary applications, which can be seen elsewhere <!-- [bartholdy] -->.
