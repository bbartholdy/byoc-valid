<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline - what is ancient dental calculus and why is it interesting?-->
Dental calculus is quickly becoming the go-to substance for exploring health and
diet in past populations [@warinnerNewEra2015].
During life, dental plaque undergoes periodic mineralisation, trapping biomolecules and
microfossils that are embedded within the dental plaque biofilm in the newly-formed
dental calculus. This process
is repeated as new plaque is deposited and subsequently mineralises, resulting in
a layered structure representing a temporal record of biofilm growth and development
[@warinnerPathogensHost2014].
The calculus then serves as a protective casing for the entrapped biomolecules and
microfossils, preserving
them for thousands of years after death and burial [@yatesOralMicrobiome2021].
Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide
range of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation
of the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations
[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],

<!-- what are current limitations of DC? hint at why we need this study -->
Dental calculus has already provided a unique and valuable insight into the past,
but the exact mechanism of the incorporation, retention, and preservation of
microfossils and biomolecules exogenous to the microbial biofilm is largely unknown;
even the process of plaque mineralisation
is not fully understood [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
This means that there may be hidden biases affecting our
interpretations of dietary/activity patterns extrapolated from ancient dental calculus.
These biases have been explored archaeologically
[@fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2022; @trompEDTACalculus2017] as well as in
contemporary humans [@leonardDentalCalculus2015] and non-human primates
[@powerChimpCalculus2015] but not experimentally.
<!-- why are biofilm models valuable? maybe move to biofilm paragraph -->

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->
<!-- How does calculus form? -->
Dental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral
cavity; however, if left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections such as
dental caries and periodontitis [@marshDentalPlaque2006].
Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), salivary
components adsorb to the crown or root and form the acquired dental pellicle.
The pellicle is
composed mainly of proteins and, in addition to protecting the tooth against
mechanical and chemical decay, provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment
[@yaoIdentificationProtein2003].
Early-coloniser species, such as those
within genus *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces*, adhere to the pellicle through
reversible long-range physicochemical forces and
irreversible short range cell-host interactions [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once
the tooth surface has been populated by specialists in surface-attachment, other
species of bacteria can attach to their surface through cell-cell interactions,
allowing adhesion of species that are not otherwise capable of adhering to a surface.
During the proces of accumulation and multiplication of bacteria, a diverse community
forms that is able to secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids,
into their immediate environment to form a biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].
<!-- composition of plaque and DC -->
The composition of a biofilm matrix is largely water (around 90% by weight), with
the remaining content consisting of cellular components, including extracellular
polysaccharides,
DNA, RNA, and proteins [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. Biofilms can become susceptible to
calcification under certain microenvironmental conditions. These
include an increased concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin
and proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased
hydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].
Under these conditions, the biofilm environment becomes favourable to increased
precipitation and decreased dissolution of calcium phosphate salts within saliva
and the plaque biofilm.
The resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts are the main
drivers of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
The primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite,
octacalcium phosphate, whitlockite, and brushite. During initial
mineralisation the main mineral component is brushite, which shifts to hydroxyapatite
in more
mature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].
The exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies among individuals due to
various factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].

Dental plaque can also be grown *in vitro*, and these oral biofilm models are
commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy
of certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010]
without the ethical issues of inducing plaque accumulation and the complexity
of access and sampling; issues that are compounded with increasing experimental
duration [@sissonsArtificialPlaque1997].
Oral biofilm models are often short-term models grown over a few days, but there
also exist longer term models (up to six weeks) used to develop mature plaque or
dental calculus
[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002]. 
The more
complex models, such as the constant-depth film fermentor [@petersConstantDepth1988]
and multi-station dental plaque microcosm [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991], have
the benefit of a continuous flow of saliva or saliva-like medium
and more control over the environment, while the simpler models using a static
nutrient reservoir
offer the advantage of increased reproducibility and generating more samples over
the same amount of time [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].
<!-- oral biofilm models. Why are they valuable and what are limitations of current models? -->
<!-- limitations of current models -->
A well-known limitation of biofilm models is the difficulty in capturing the
diversity and complexity of baterial communities and metabolic dependencies,
micro-environments, nutrient availability, and host immune-responses in the natural
oral biome
[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013].
These limitations can be overcome by complex experimental setups, but at the cost
of lower throughput and increased requirements for laboratory facilities.
While *in vivo* research on dental calculus offers a more realistic
setting for addressing certain questions, it suffers from a lack of control.
There are many variables involved in dental calculus formation and accurate dietary
intake, such as intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow, oral pH,
and amylase activity. These can be hard to tease apart *in situ*. Oral biofilm models
provide a controlled environment to explore the effect of any number of variables
on the outcome, and can be a beneficial complement to *in vivo* studies.

Despite the success of their application
in dental research, oral biofilm models have yet to be widely adopted in archaeological
research, perhaps because the scope of research is very different and the facilities
for performing microbiological experiments are specialised.
In some cases we can draw on the previous research conducted in clinical dentistry,
but often we are asking different questions in archaeology. We are interested in
learning
more about how dietary residues and microremains become trapped in calculus, and
how the methods we use may inadvertently bias our interpretations
[@radiniDirtyTeeth2022], whereas clinically the main goal is advances in dental
health and treatment. Both lines of research can benefit from using oral biofilm
models, but the application of the models is to some extent mutually exclusive.

<!-- What did we do and why?
clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study 
Justify the methods we chose and how they relate to the questions we're asking about
the model and what questions we want to ask with the model-->

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental
calculus for archaeological research questions.
It is a multispecies biofilm using whole saliva as the inoculate, with a simple
multiwell plate setup that is accessible even to smaller lab budgets and those
with limited facilities for microbiology work.
Raw potato and wheat starch solutions were added during the biofilm growth to
explore the biases involved in their incorporation and extraction from dental
calculus. These results are presented in a separate article [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].
Here, we used next-generation sequencing and metagenomic classification
to characterise the bacterial composition of our model dental calculus. This was
done to ensure that the model microbiome is predominantly oral and not overgrown
by environmental contaminants, as well as testing for
contamination during the biofilm growth period. We compare our results to
oral reference samples, including saliva, buccal mucose, plaque, and modern human
dental calculus.
We then determined the composition of the model dental calculus using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to verify the presence of calculus-specific
mineral phases and functional groups, and perform a qualitative comparison with
modern and archaeological reference calculus. 

Overall the model calculus is chemically similar to natural calculus, and has
an oral core microbiome.
The microbial diversity and richness within the model samples were lower than
oral reference samples, suggesting that the model samples are not as well-balanced
in species composition and abundances as the natural samples. The main differences
seem to be related to oxygen tolerance of the species present, with model calculus
having higher abundance of (facultative) anaerobic species.
The microbial composition also differs from natural samples, as they grouped
separately from
natural calculus and other oral reference samples, while grouping more closely
with *in vitro* reference samples from @edlundUncoveringComplex2018.
The mineral composition closely resembled modern and archaeological reference
calculus, predominantly comprised of carbonate hydroxyapatite with a similar level of
crystallinity and order.  
As such, the model dental calculus presented here is a viable proxy to natural
dental calculus and can be used to explore many of the currently unexplained
processes we see in the archaeological material, when working within the
limitations of an oral biofilm model.
In addition to the benefit of increased control over parameters involved in
calculus formation and dietary incorporation, our method also provides unlimited
material for experimentation, rather than using limited archaeological material.
It is not meant to replace studies conducted on archaeological and
natural dental calculus, rather balance limitations of each method and serve as
a complementary approach to expand our toolkit.
