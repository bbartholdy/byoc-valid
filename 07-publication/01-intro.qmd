<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline - what is ancient dental calculus and why is it interesting?-->

Dental calculus is becoming an increasingly popular substance for exploring health and
diet in past populations [@warinnerNewEra2015].
During life, dental plaque undergoes periodic mineralisation, trapping biomolecules and
microfossils that are embedded within the dental plaque biofilm in the newly-formed
dental calculus. This process
is repeated as new plaque is deposited and subsequently mineralises, resulting in
a layered structure representing a temporal record of biofilm growth and development
[@warinnerPathogensHost2014].
The calculus serves as a protective casing for the entrapped biomolecules and
microfossils, preserving
them for thousands of years after death and burial [@yatesOralMicrobiome2021].
Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide
range of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation
of the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations
[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],
as well as extraction of microbotanical remains
[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranules2009;@mickleburghNewInsights2012; @maHumanDiet2022]
and other residues to infer dietary patterns and nicotine use

Dental calculus has already provided a unique and valuable insight into the past,
but the exact mechanism of the incorporation, retention, and preservation of
microfossils and biomolecules exogenous to the microbial biofilm is largely unknown;
even the process of plaque mineralisation
is not fully understood [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
This means that there may be hidden biases affecting our
interpretations of dietary/activity patterns extrapolated from ancient dental calculus.
These biases have been explored archaeologically
[@fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2022; @trompEDTACalculus2017] as well as in
contemporary humans [@leonardPlantMicroremains2015] and non-human primates
[@powerChimpCalculus2015], but not experimentally.

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->
<!-- How does calculus form? -->
Dental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral
cavity. However, when left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections, such as
dental caries and periodontitis, and/or mineralisation [@marshDentalPlaque2006].
The dental plaque biofilm grows in a well-characterized manner before mineralisation,
in a process that repeats regularly to build up dental calculus.
Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), salivary
components adsorb to the crown or root and form the acquired dental pellicle.
The pellicle provides a viable surface for bacteria to attach, especially
early-coloniser species within the genera *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces*
[@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once
the tooth surface has been populated by specialists in surface-attachment, other
species of bacteria can attach to the adherent cells, increasing the biofilm density
and diversity. The bacterial species secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids,
and nucleic acids, into their immediate environment to form a matrix that provides
structural support, nutrition, and allows for environmental niche partitioning
[@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].
<!-- composition of plaque and DC -->

Biofilms can become susceptible to
calcification under certain microenvironmental conditions, including an increased
concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin
and proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased
hydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].
These conditions can cause increased precipitation and decreased dissolution of
calcium phosphate salts within saliva and the plaque biofilm.
The resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts is the main
driver of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
The primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite,
octacalcium phosphate, whitlockite, and brushite. During initial
mineralisation the main mineral component is brushite, which shifts to hydroxyapatite
in more
mature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].
The exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies among individuals due to
various factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].

Dental plaque can also be grown *in vitro*, and these oral biofilm models are
commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy
of certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010]
without the ethical issues of inducing plaque accumulation in study participants
and the complexity of access and sampling in humans or animals.
Oral biofilm models are often short-term models grown over a few days, but
longer term models also exist (up to six weeks) which are used to develop mature plaque or
dental calculus
[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002; @velskoConsistentReproducible2018]. 
<!-- oral biofilm models. Why are they valuable and what are limitations of current models? -->
<!-- limitations of current models -->
A well-known limitation of biofilm models is the difficulty in capturing the
diversity and complexity of bacterial communities and metabolic dependencies,
micro-environments, nutrient availability, and host immune-responses in the natural
oral biome
[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013; @velskoConsistentReproducible2018; @velskoCytokineResponse2017].
These limitations can be overcome by complex experimental setups, but at the cost
of lower throughput and increased requirements for laboratory facilities.

Despite the limitations, oral biofilm models have many benefits over *in situ* research.
There are many variables involved in dental calculus formation, such as intra-
and inter-individual variation in salivary flow, oral pH,
and amylase activity, which can be hard to tease apart *in situ*.
Oral biofilm models provide a controlled environment to explore the effect of
selected variables on the growth of calculus and the retention of dietary
components in the biofilm, as well as a means to identify
how the methods used in archaeology may inadvertently bias the interpretations.
This type of research has, so far, been limited, but has the potential to greatly benefit
archaeological research on past diet [@radiniDirtyTeeth2022].

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental
calculus for archaeology-oriented research questions.
It is a multispecies biofilm using whole saliva as the inoculate, with a simple
multiwell plate setup that is accessible even to smaller lab budgets and those
with limited facilities for microbiology work.
Here, we used next-generation sequencing and metagenomic classification
to characterise the bacterial composition of our model dental calculus and compare
it to oral reference samples, including saliva, buccal mucosa, plaque, and modern human
dental calculus. This was done to ensure that the model microbiome is predominantly
oral and not overgrown by environmental contaminants.
We then determined the mineral composition of the model dental calculus using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to verify the presence of calculus-specific
mineral phases and functional groups, and perform a qualitative comparison with
modern and archaeological reference calculus. 
Overall the model calculus is chemically similar to natural calculus, and has
a predominantly oral microbiome.
The microbial diversity and richness within the model samples were lower than
oral reference samples, suggesting that the model samples do not contain identical
species composition and abundances as the natural samples.
The mineral composition closely resembles modern and archaeological reference
calculus, predominantly comprised of carbonate hydroxyapatite with a similar level of
crystallinity and order.
As such, the model dental calculus presented here is a viable proxy to natural
dental calculus and can be used to explore many of the currently unexplained
processes we see in the archaeological material, when working within the
limitations of an oral biofilm model.
