<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline -->

Dental calculus is quickly becoming the go-to substance for exploring health and
diet in past populations. Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide
range of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation
of the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->
<!-- dental plaque/calculus formation and calculus composition -->
Dental calculus is formed by the mineralisation of dental plaque.
Dental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral
cavity; however, if left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections such as
dental caries and periodontitis [@marshDentalPlaque2006].
Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), a salivary
pellicle adsorbs to the surface of the tooth, in most cases enamel, forming the acquired
dental pellicle. The pellicle is
comprised mainly of proteins and, in addition to protecting the tooth against mechanical
and chemical decay, provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment [@yaoIdentificationProtein2003].
Shortly after adsorbing to the enamel, early-coloniser species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and
*Actinomyces*, adhere to the pellicle through reversible long-range physicochemical forces and
irreversible short range cell-host<!--check--> interactions [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once the surface
has been populated by the specialists in surface-attachment, other species of bacteria
can attach to their surface through cell-cell interactions, allowing adhesion of species
that are not otherwise capable of adhering to a surface. After accumulation and multiplication
of bacteria, this, now, diverse community of is able
to secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, into their immediate
environment to form a biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].
The matrix provides an adaptive advantage
to the organisms within through resistance to antibiotics and mechanical
removal, as well as transporting nutrients from outside the biofilm and facilitating
distribution of resources between bacterial communities within the biofilm
[@petersonViscoelasticityBiofilms2015; @jainIsolationCharacterization2013].

The composition of a biofilm matrix is largely water (around 90%), with the
remaining content consisting of microbes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS),
DNA, RNA, and proteins [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. Biofilms can become susceptible to
calcification under certain microenvironmental conditions. These
include an increased concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin
and proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased
hydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].
Under these conditions, the biofilm environment becomes favourable to increased
precipitation and decreased dissolution of calcium phosphate salts within saliva
and the plaque biofilm.
The resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts are the main
drivers of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
Mineralisation
generally starts from within the biofilm matrix as a result of nucleation, followed
by mineralisation of the matrix and, subsequently, bacterial cells.
The susceptibility of crystallisation in bacteria depends on the composition
and concentration of membrane-associated components, such as proteolipids and
phospholipids [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].
Binding of calcium to bacterial membranes is facilitated by phospholipid molecules
within the cell membrane,
followed by association of phosphates with the bound calcium to form calcium
phosphate complexes. These complexes are active in promoting the formation and
deposition of hydroxyapatite within biofilms [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].

The primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite (HAP),
octacalcium phosphate (OCP), whitlockite (WHT), and brushite (BHT). During initial
mineralisation the main mineral component is BHT, which shifts to HAP in more
mature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].
The exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies by individual due to
various factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecificMineral2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].

The role of bacteria in dental
calculus formation is still not clear, and dental calculus formation has been
induced in bacteria-free rodents [@glasBiophysicalStudies1962].
However, given the abundance of bacteria present
within human dental plaque, the structure of calculus will reflect the presence of bacteria
with human dental calculus containing a heterogenous mineral composition across the biofilm
due to the differing mineralisation properties in bacteria, and also directly influences the
porosity of calculus [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005]. <!-- rephrase: need to emphasise the importance of bacteria in human dental calculus - better proxy -->
<!-- biofilm maturation and mineralisation -->
<!-- dental calculus composition and distribution -->
The different susceptibility of certain bacteria to mineralise may explain differences
in bacterial profiles in plaque and dental calculus [@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019]

Attachment of dental calculus to enamel is further solidified by fusion of dental calculus
with enamel rods [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].

The organic component of dental calculus consists of proteins and lipids,
likely incorporated from bacteria, saliva, and food [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].
Calculus forming above the gumline (supragingival) has a lower inorganic content
than calculus forming below the gumline (subgingival) [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].

<!-- oral biofilm models. History, types, etc. -->
Oral biofilm models are commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy
of certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010].
These are often short-term models grown over a few days, but there also exist longer
term models used to develop dental calculus
[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002]. 
There are multiple different types of models ranging from simplistic agar plate or
multiwell-plate models [@ceriCalgaryBiofilmDevice1999; @extercateAAA2010],
to more complex setups like the constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) [@petersConstantDepth1988]
and the multi-station artificial mouth (MAM) [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]. The more
complex models have the benefit of a continuous flow of saliva or saliva-like medium
and control over the environment, while the multiwell-plate models offer the advantage
of generating more samples over the same amount of time [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].
Simplistic models restricted to a select subset of oral bacteria are often more
reproducible than models using whole saliva, while the latter are more representative
of the *in vivo* oral microbiome complexity [@roderStudyingBacterial2016; @mcbainBiofilmModels2009].

<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental
calculus,
and provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past.
The need for such a model is warranted by the different questions that are asked by
archaeologists compared to clinical dentistry. We are interested in learning
more about how dietary residues and microremains become trapped in calculus,
and how the methods we use may inadvertently bias our interpretations; questions
that are best addressed in a lab using a model.
We used FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification
to characterise the bacterial composition, and compared our results against
modern and archaeological human dental calculus. We found that
the mineral and organic components mimic that of the modern reference calculus
used for comparison, while the bacterial classification revealed a similar
but distinct community structure.<!--The bacterial composition -->
In addition to the benefit of increased control over parameters involved in
calculus formation and dietary incorporation, our method also provides unlimited
material for experimentation, rather than using the limited archaeological material
currently available.
