# Introduction

<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline -->

Dental calculus is quickly becoming the go-to substance for exploring health and
diet in past populations. Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide
range of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation
of the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations
[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncientCalcified2013; @warinnerPathogensHostImmunity2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],
extraction of microbotanical remains
[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;@mickleburghNewInsightsConsumption2012]
and other residues [@buckleyDentalCalculusCooking2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018]
to infer dietary patterns, and nicotine-use [@eerkensDentalCalculusSource2018].

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->

<!-- dental plaque/calculus formation and calculus composition -->
Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), the salivary
pellicle attaches to the teeth. The salivary pellicle is comprised of ... 
and provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment, prompting early-coloniser
species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces*, to adhere to the tooth. 


<!-- oral biofilm models. History, types, etc. -->
Oral biofilm models are commonly used in dental research to...

No applications so far in archaeology.


<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental calculus,
and provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past. 
We validated the
model using FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification
to verify the bacterial composition against real dental calculus. We found that
the mineral and organic composition...

The method essentially provides unlimited material for experimentation, rather
than using the limited archaeological material currently available.
