<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline -->

Dental calculus is quickly becoming the go-to substance for exploring health and
diet in past populations. Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide
range of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation
of the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations
[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],
extraction of microbotanical remains
[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;@mickleburghNewInsights2012]
and other residues [@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018]
to infer dietary patterns, and nicotine-use [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018].

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->
<!-- dental plaque/calculus formation and calculus composition -->
Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), a salivary
pellicle attaches to the teeth forming the acquired pellicle. The pellicle is
comprised mainly of proteins and provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment,
prompting early-coloniser species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and
*Actinomyces*, to attach to the tooth [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once the surface
has been populated by the specialists in surface-attachment, other species of bacteria
can attach to their surface, allowing adhesion of species that are not usually
capable of attaching to a surface. This, now, diverse community of bacteria is able
to secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, into their immediate
environment to form a biofilm matrix. The matrix provides an adaptive advantage
to the organisms within by maintaining resistance to antibiotics and mechanical
removal, as well as transporting nutrients from outside the biofilm and facilitating
distribution of nutrition within [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016; @jainIsolationCharacterization2013].

Dental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral
cavity; however, if left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections such as
dental caries and periodontitis [@marshDentalPlaque2006].

The composition of a biofilm matrix is largely water (around 90%), with the
remaining content consisting of microbes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS),
DNA, RNA, and proteins [@bergerOralBiofilms2018].Biofilms can become susceptible to
calcification under certain environmental conditions. These
include an increased concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin
and proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased
hydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].
Under these conditions, the biofilm environment becomes favourable to increased
precipitation and decreased dissolution of calcium phosphate salts within plaque.
The resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts are the main
drivers of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].

The primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite (HAP),
octacalcium phosphate (OCP), whitlockite (WHT), and brushite (BHT). During initial
mineralisation the main mineral component is BHT, which shifts to HAP in more
mature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].
The exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies by individual due to
various factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecificMineral2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].
Mineralisation
generally starts from within the biofilm matrix as a result of nucleation, followed
by crystallisation of bacterial cells, resulting in irreversible and extensive
degradation of the organisms [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].
The susceptibility of crystallisation in bacteria depends on the composition
and concentration of membrane-associated components, such as proteolipids and
phospholipids.

.........binding of calcium to membrane by phospholipid molecules,
followed by association of phosphates with the bound calcium to form calcium
phosphate complexes [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002]. The role of bacteria in dental
calculus formation is still not clear, and dental calculus formation has been
induced in bacteria-free environments [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].

However, given the bacteria are present
within human dental calculus, the structure will likely reflect the presence of bacteria
with human dental calculus containing a heterogenous mineral composition across the biofilm

due to the differing mineralisation properties in bacteria, and also directly influences the
porosity of calculus [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005]. <!-- rephrase: need to emphasise the importance of bacteria in human dental calculus - better proxy -->
<!-- biofilm maturation and mineralisation -->
<!-- dental calculus composition and distribution -->
The different susceptibility of certain bacteria to mineralise may explain differences
in bacterial profiles in plaque and dental calculus [@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019]

The organic component of dental calculus consists of proteins and lipids,
likely incorporated from bacteria, saliva, and food [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].
Calculus forming above the gumline (supragingival) has a lower inorganic content
than calculus forming below the gumline (subgingival) [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].

The inorganic component of dental calculus consists of

<!-- oral biofilm models. History, types, etc. -->
Oral biofilm models are commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy
of certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010].
These are often short-term models grown over a few days, but there also exist longer
term models used to develop dental calculus
[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002]. 
There are multiple different types of models ranging from simplistic agar plate or
multiwell-plate models [@ceriCalgaryBiofilmDevice1999; @extercateAAA2010],
to more complex setups like the constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) [@petersConstantDepth1988]
and the multi-station artificial mouth (MAM) [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]. The more
complex models have the benefit of a continuous flow of saliva or saliva-like medium
and control over the environment, while the multiwell-plate models offer the advantage
of generating more samples over the same amount of time [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].

As far as we know, archaelogists have not yet made use of biofilm models in their
research.

<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental
calculus,
and provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past.
We validated the
model using FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification
to verify the bacterial composition against real dental calculus. We found that
the mineral and organic components mimic that of the modern reference calculus
used for comparison, while the bacterial classification revealed.........
<!--The bacterial composition -->

The method essentially provides unlimited material for experimentation, rather
than using the limited archaeological material currently available.
