# Introduction

<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline -->

Dental calculus...

<!-- In more recent years, the study of dental calculus has increased exponentially, 
and the wealth of information contained within the mineralised matrix has been, 
to a larger extent, acknowledged; the benefits of which span a wide variety of
archaeological research areas, such as oral microbiome 
characterisation (including pathogens) through the analysis of DNA and proteins 
[@adlerSequencingAncientCalcified2013; @warinnerPathogensHostImmunity2014],
microbotanical remains [@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;
@mickleburghNewInsightsConsumption2012], 
other organic residues from dietary compounds [@buckleyDentalCalculusCooking2014], 
and nicotine-use [@eerkensDentalCalculusSource2018]. -->

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->

Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), the salivary
pellicle attaches to the teeth. The salivary pellicle is comprised of ... 
and provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment, prompting early-coloniser
species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces*, to adhere to the tooth.


<!-- oral biofilm models -->



<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->

We present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental calculus,
and provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past. 
We validated the
model using FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification
to verify the bacterial composition against real dental calculus. We found that
the mineral and organic composition...
<!--The bacterial composition -->

The method essentially provides unlimited material for experimentation, rather
than using the limited archaeological material currently available.
