Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide\nrange of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation\nof the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],\nextraction of microbotanical remains\n[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;@mickleburghNewInsights2012;@maHumanDiet2022]\nand other residues to infer dietary patterns and nicotine-use\n[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018; @eerkensDentalCalculus2018].\n\n<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->\n<!-- dental plaque/calculus formation and calculus composition -->\nDental calculus is formed by the mineralisation of dental plaque.\nDental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral\ncavity; however, if left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections such as\ndental caries and periodontitis [@marshDentalPlaque2006].\nShortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), a salivary\npellicle adsorbs to the surface of the tooth, in most cases enamel, forming the acquired\ndental pellicle. The pellicle is\ncomprised mainly of proteins and, in addition to protecting the tooth against mechanical\nand chemical decay, provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment [@yaoIdentificationProtein2003].\nShortly after adsorbing to the enamel, early-coloniser species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and\n*Actinomyces*, adhere to the pellicle through reversible long-range physicochemical forces and\nirreversible short range cell-host<!--check--> interactions [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once the surface\nhas been populated by the specialists in surface-attachment, other species of bacteria\ncan attach to their surface through cell-cell interactions, allowing adhesion of species\nthat are not otherwise capable of adhering to a surface. After accumulation and multiplication\nof bacteria, this, now, diverse community of is able\nto secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, into their immediate\nenvironment to form a biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].\nThe matrix provides an adaptive advantage\nto the organisms within through resistance to antibiotics and mechanical\nremoval, as well as transporting nutrients from outside the biofilm and facilitating\ndistribution of resources between bacterial communities within the biofilm\n[@petersonViscoelasticityBiofilms2015; @jainIsolationCharacterization2013].\n\nThe composition of a biofilm matrix is largely water (around 90%), with the\nremaining content consisting of microbes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS),\nDNA, RNA, and proteins [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. Biofilms can become susceptible to\ncalcification under certain microenvironmental conditions. These\ninclude an increased concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin\nand proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased\nhydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].\nUnder these conditions, the biofilm environment becomes favourable to increased\nprecipitation and decreased dissolution of calcium phosphate salts within saliva\nand the plaque biofilm.\nThe resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts are the main\ndrivers of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nMineralisation\ngenerally starts from within the biofilm matrix as a result of nucleation, followed\nby mineralisation of the matrix and, subsequently, bacterial cells.\nThe susceptibility of crystallisation in bacteria depends on the composition\nand concentration of membrane-associated components, such as proteolipids and\nphospholipids [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nBinding of calcium to bacterial membranes is facilitated by phospholipid molecules\nwithin the cell membrane,\nfollowed by association of phosphates with the bound calcium to form calcium\nphosphate complexes. These complexes are active in promoting the formation and\ndeposition of hydroxyapatite within biofilms [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\n\nThe primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite (HAP),\noctacalcium phosphate (OCP), whitlockite (WHT), and brushite (BHT). During initial\nmineralisation the main mineral component is BHT, which shifts to HAP in more\nmature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].\nThe exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies by individual due to\nvarious factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecificMineral2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].\n\nThe role of bacteria in dental\ncalculus formation is still not clear, and dental calculus formation has been\ninduced in bacteria-free rodents [@glasBiophysicalStudies1962].\nHowever, given the abundance of bacteria present\nwithin human dental plaque, the structure of calculus will reflect the presence of bacteria\nwith human dental calculus containing a heterogenous mineral composition across the biofilm\ndue to the differing mineralisation properties in bacteria, and also directly influences the\nporosity of calculus [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005]. <!-- rephrase: need to emphasise the importance of bacteria in human dental calculus - better proxy -->\n<!-- biofilm maturation and mineralisation -->\n<!-- dental calculus composition and distribution -->\nThe different susceptibility of certain bacteria to mineralise may explain differences\nin bacterial profiles in plaque and dental calculus [@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019]\n\nAttachment of dental calculus to enamel is further solidified by fusion of dental calculus\nwith enamel rods [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\n\nThe organic component of dental calculus consists of proteins and lipids,\nlikely incorporated from bacteria, saliva, and food [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nCalculus forming above the gumline (supragingival) has a lower inorganic content\nthan calculus forming below the gumline (subgingival) [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\n\n<!-- oral biofilm models. History, types, etc. -->\nOral biofilm models are commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy\nof certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010].\nThese are often short-term models grown over a few days, but there also exist longer\nterm models used to develop dental calculus\n[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002]. \nThere are multiple different types of models ranging from simplistic agar plate or\nmultiwell-plate models [@ceriCalgaryBiofilmDevice1999; @extercateAAA2010],\nto more complex setups like the constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) [@petersConstantDepth1988]\nand the multi-station artificial mouth (MAM) [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]. The more\ncomplex models have the benefit of a continuous flow of saliva or saliva-like medium\nand control over the environment, while the multiwell-plate models offer the advantage\nof generating more samples over the same amount of time [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].\nSimplistic models restricted to a select subset of oral bacteria are often more\nreproducible than models using whole saliva, while the latter are more representative\nof the *in vivo* oral microbiome complexity [@roderStudyingBacterial2016; @mcbainBiofilmModels2009].\n\n<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->\n\nWe present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental\ncalculus,\nand provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past.\nThe need for such a model is warranted by the different questions that are asked by\narchaeologists compared to clinical dentistry. We are interested in learning\nmore about how dietary residues and microremains become trapped in calculus,\nand how the methods we use may inadvertently bias our interpretations; questions\nthat are best addressed in a lab using a model.\nWe used FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification\nto characterise the bacterial composition, and compared our results against\nmodern and archaeological human dental calculus. We found that\nthe mineral and organic components mimic that of the modern reference calculus\nused for comparison, while the bacterial classification revealed a similar\nbut distinct community structure.<!--The bacterial composition -->\nIn addition to the benefit of increased control over parameters involved in\ncalculus formation and dietary incorporation, our method also provides unlimited\nmaterial for experimentation, rather than using the limited archaeological material\ncurrently available.\n\n\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# Materials and methods\n<!-- Create table for all samples and indicate which samples underwent DNA, FTIR, etc. -->\n\n\n\n## Biofilm growth\n\nIn this study we employ a multispecies oral biofilm model following a modified\nprotocol from Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991] and\nShellis [-@shellisSyntheticSalivaCultural1978]. The setup comprises a polypropylene\n24 deepwell PCR plate (KingFisher 97003510) with a lid containing 24 pegs (substrata), which\nis autoclaved at 120&deg;C, 1 bar overpressure, for 20 mins.\n\nThe artificial saliva (AS) is a modified version of the basal medium mucin (BMM)\ndescribed by Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\nIt is a complex medium containing 2.5 g/l partially purified mucin from porcine\nstomach (Type III, Sigma M1778),\n5 g/l trypticase peptone (Roth 2363.1), 10 g/l proteose peptone (Oxoid LP0085),\n5 g/l yeast extract (BD 211921), 2.5 g/l KCl, 0.35 g/l NaCl, 1.8 mmol/l CaCl~2~,\n5.2 mmol/l Na~2~HPO~4~ [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991], 6.4 mmol/l NaHCO~3~\n[@shellisSyntheticSalivaCultural1978], 2.5 mg/l haemin. This is subsequently\nadjusted to pH 7 with NaOH pellets and stirring, autoclaved (15 min, 120&deg;C,\n1 bar overpressure), and supplemented with 5.8 \\(mu\\)mol/l menadione, 5 mmol/l urea,\nand 1 mmol/l arginine [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\n\n<!-- add to protocols.io -->\nFresh whole saliva (WS) for inoculation was provided by a 31-year-old male donor\nwith no history of caries, who abstained from oral hygiene for 24 hours, and no\nfood was consumed two hours prior to donation. No antibiotics were taken up to six\nmonths prior to donation.\nThe saliva was filtered through a sterilised (with bleach) nylon cloth to remove\nparticulates.\nSubstrata were inoculated with 1 ml/well of a two-fold dilution of WS in sterilised\n20% glycerine for four hours at 36&deg;C, to allow attachment of the\nsalivary pellicle and plaque-forming bacteria. After initial inoculation, the\nsubstrata were transferred to a new plate containing 1 ml/well AS and incubated\nat 36&deg;C, 30 rpm. The inoculation process was repeated on days 3 and 5.\nAS was partially refreshed once per day and fully refreshed every three days,\nthroughout the experiment, by transferring the substrata to a new plate containing\nAS. To feed the bacteria, the substrata were transferred to a new plate, containing\n5% (w/v) sucrose, for six minutes twice daily, except on inoculation days\n(days 0, 3, and 5), where the samples only received one sucrose treatment after\ninoculation.\n\nStarch treatments were initiated on day 9 to avoid starch granule counts being\naffected by $alpha$-amylase hydrolysis from inoculation saliva. An $\\alpha$-amylase\nassay confirmed the absence of any $\\alpha$-amylase activity in the system\n[@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2021].\nStarch treatments replaced sucrose treatments, occurring twice per day\nfor six minutes. The starch treatments involved transferring the substrata to a\nnew plate containing a 0.25% (w/v) starch from potato (Roth 9441.1) solution, a\n0.25% (w/v) starch from wheat (Sigma S5127) solution, and a 0.5% (w/v) mixture of equal\nconcentrations (w/v) wheat and potato. All starch solutions were created in a 5%\n(w/v) sucrose solution. Before transferring biofilm samples to the starch treatments,\nthe starch plates were agitated to keep the starches in suspension in the solutions,\nand during treatments, the rpm was increased to 60.\n\nAfter 15 days, mineralisation was encouraged with a\ncalcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing\n20 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 12 mmol/l NaH~2~PO~4~, 5 mmol/l Na~2~PO~3~F, 500 mmol/l Urea\n[@pearceConcomitantDepositionStrontium1987; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991],\nand (0.04 g/l MgCl). The substrata were submerged in 1 ml/well CPMU five times daily,\nevery two hours, for six minutes. During the mineralisation period, starch treatments\nwere reduced to once per day after the five CPMU treatments. This cycle was repeated\nfor 10 days until the end of the experiment on day 24\n(see \\@ref(fig:protocol-fig) for an overview of protocol). A more detailed\nprotocol is available at<!-- protocols.io -->.\n\nAll laboratory work was conducted in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood\nto prevent starch and bacterial contamination. Control samples were included to\ndetect starch contamination.\n\n## Metagenomics\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|#SampleID    |Env             |\n|:------------|:---------------|\n|LIB030.A0117 |library control |\n|SYN001.A0101 |saliva          |\n|SYN002.A0101 |saliva          |\n|SYN003.A0101 |saliva          |\n|SYN014.A0101 |medium          |\n|SYN014.C0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.B0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.D0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.E0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.F0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.G0101 |medium          |\n|SYN015.H0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.A0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.B0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.D0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.E0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.F0101 |medium          |\n|SYN017.G0101 |medium          |\n|SYN018.C0101 |medium          |\n|SYN018.H0101 |medium          |\n|SYN005.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN006.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN008.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN009.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN012.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN013.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN015.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN016.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN018.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN019.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN021.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN022.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN023.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN025.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN026.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n|SYN028.I0101 |byoc_calculus   |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<!-- Samples sent to Jena -->\nA total of 36 samples were taken during the experiment from\nthe donated saliva, artificial saliva, and from the\nbiofilm end-product on day 24.\nDNA extraction was performed at the archaeogenetic facility at the Max Planck\nInstitute for the Science of Human History (Jena, Germany).

Samples were analysed\nat the Laboratory for Sedimentary Archaeology, Haifa University. The analysis was\nconducted with a Thermo Nicolet is5 spectrometer in transmission, at 4 cm$^{-1}$\nresolution, with an average of 32 scans between wavenumbers 4000 and 400 cm$^{-1}$.\n\nAnalysis was conducted on 28 biofilm samples from days\n7, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Some samples from the same sampling day had to be\ncombined to provide enough material for analysis. Samples analysed for FTIR\noriginated from a different experiment than the metagenomic samples, following\nthe same protocol (as described above).\nSamples were analysed following the method presented in\n@asscherAtomicDisorder2011. A few $\\mu$g of each sample were repeatedly ground\ntogether with KBr and pressed in a 7 mm die under two tons of pressure using a\nSpecac mini-pellet press (Specac Ltd., GS01152).\nRepeated measurements of the splitting factor were taken after each grind, and a\ngrind curve was produced following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011. Samples were\nground and analysed up to six times (sample suffix a-f) for the grinding curve.\nGrinding curves were prepared for samples from days 16, 20, and 24. No grind\ncurves were produced for samples from days 7 and 12. These were largely composed\nof organics and proteins, and did not form enough carbonated hydroxtapatite for\nanalysis. The splitting factor of carbonate hydroxyapatite was calculated using\na macro script, following @weinerStatesPreservation1990, by dividing the sum of\nthe height of the absorptions at 603 cm$^{-1}$ and 567 cm$^{-1}$ in the height\nof the valley between them. Following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011 we plotted the\nIRSF against the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main absorption at 1035,\nand compared our grinding curves to the ones produced by @asscherAtomicDisorder2011.\n\nSplitting factors of the doublet, and FWHM of the main PO~4~ peak at 1040 were\ncalculated from the grinding measurements, and plotted against each other to\ncreate grinding curves to explore crystallinity (crystal size) and the order and\ndisorder.

The presence of water indicated by\nthe O--H stretch is also consistent with a biofilm, which is around 90%\nwater [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. As the samples mature, the ratio of proteins\nand lipids to phosphates shift from predominance of organic content to\ninorganic content in the form of carbonated hydroxyapatite.\n\nEarly spectra, days 7 and 12, are also similar to collagen spectra, with the\nOH absorbance band at around 3400 cm$^{-1}$, amide I, II, and III peaks at\n1659, 1552, and 1240 cm$^{-1}$, respectively \n[@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005; @martinezcortizasLinkingStructural2020].\n\nThe archaeological and modern reference spectra are largely indistinguishable and\nconsist of an O--H absorbance band (3400 cm$^{-1}$), CH~3~ bands (3000--2900 cm$^{-1}$),\ncarbonate (1420, 1458-1450, 875-870 cm$^{-1}$), amide I band (1650 cm$^{-1}$), and phosphates\n(1040, 604, 566 cm$^{-1}$).\n\nThe biofilm samples from the end of the experiment are similar to both reference\nsamples. The main\ndifference is a lower organic component in reference samples seen as a reduced\namide I peak at around 1637 compared to the carbonate peak at around 1420, and\nan absence of amide II and III.

No appreciable differences between days 16, 20, and 24. The archaeological\ndental calculus does show a slightly increased slope compared to model calculus\nfrom the three sampling days used in the grind curve.\n\n\n\n# Discussion\n\n# Discussion\n\n<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->\nIn this study we present a [long-term] oral biofilm model with mineralisation\nto produce model dental calculus. The aim of the model is to address\na variety of research questions related to dental calculus, both in the present\nand in the past.\nWe also assess the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus.\n\nused metagenomic classification and FTIR to  in bacterial and mineral content.\nThe performance of our model as a proxy for dental calculus was evaluated\nusing metagenomic screening for bacterial composition, and FTIR for mineral \nstructure.\n<!-- Scientific findings as extension of previous work -->\n\n<!-- Findings' scientific implications -->\n\n<!-- secondary findings -->\n<!-- metagenomics -->\nWhile our model is not an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to have outcompeted\naerobes and facultative anaerobes over the course of the experiment. This may\nbe a result of biofilm microenvironments, where species can produce favourable\nenvironments within biofilms<!--cite-->.\n\n<!-- FTIR discussion-->\nExperimental samples are indicative of biofilm growth and maturation, including\nmineralisation, represented by a reduction in proteins and lipids (1460, 1420, 870)\nand the increasing intensity of peaks related to carbonated hydroxyapatite (1040,\n600-550 cm$^{-1}$) over the course of the experiment.\n\nThe presence of collagen in dental calculus (and saliva) is still not clear. It\nmay be a result of external contamination [@mackiePreservationMetaproteome2017]\nor end-products\nof collagen degradation (e.g. carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, ICTP)\nwhich may or may not be related to periodontitis\n[@gursoySalivaryCollagen2013]. It is more likely that the proline-rich proteins\n(secondary amine) present in the samples are attributed to the biofilm\nmatrix.\n\nThe artificial samples from day 24 resemble both the modern reference samples and\nthe archaeological sample in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper\nslope of the archaeological sample may suggest larger crystals, which is to be\nexpected, as the inorganic crystals expand into the space left by degrading\norganic matter over time [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010]. More samples are\nneeded to see if this is consistent in archaeological samples.\nOverall, the spectra of the artificial calculus show an increase in the\ninorganic component and a decrease in the organic component over time.\nThe grinding curves for days 16, 20, and 24 were very similar, suggesting\nthat the CPMU solution (introduced on day 16) may not have much of an effect.\n\n<!-- How this engineering will facilitate future research -->\n\n<!-- Forward-looking statements about the field as a whole -->\n\n<!-- a summary/importance of the engineering aspect of the work -->\n\n<!-- How it facilitates scientific research -->\n\n<!-- limitations of the platform show which questions would be unanswered -->\nResearch relating to $alpha$-amylase activity and its effect on the oral biome\n(whether dietary or otherwise) requires addition of amylase to the microcosm, as\nit is not present in the naturally in the system (as shown in <!--cite starch paper-->). The reason for the absence of $alpha$-amylase is not clear...\nThere is of course no renewable source for $alpha$-amylase once the inoculations\nhave been completed; furthermore, there does not seem to be any retention of $alpha$-amylase\nby amylase-binding streptococci (ABS).\nABS are present in the system, but do not seem to be binding amylase. At this point\nwe are unable to explain why. \n<!-- Is it possible that the mixture of sucrose in the starch solutions eliminates the need to feed on starch? -->\n\n<!-- dominance of aerobes may affect interpretation of dietary studies \nAlthough samples were quite consitent within the experiment-->\n\n<!-- BacDive limited info - more than 50% missing oxygen tolerance info-->\n\n<!-- modern calculus references samples were all from the same geographic origin -->\n\nSingle donor may have affected diversity of model. Donated saliva had a lower mean\nalpha-diversity than other saliva samples.\n\n<!-- CPMU was mixed under sterile conditions, but the solution itself was not\nsterilised (not sure if it can be), so may have introduced contamination.
