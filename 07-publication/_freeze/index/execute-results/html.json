Studies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide\nrange of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation\nof the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],\nextraction of microbotanical remains\n[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;@mickleburghNewInsights2012;@maHumanDiet2022]\nand other residues to infer dietary patterns and nicotine-use\n[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018; @eerkensDentalCalculus2018].\n\n<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->\n<!-- dental plaque/calculus formation and calculus composition -->\nDental calculus is formed by the mineralisation of dental plaque.\nDental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral\ncavity; however, if left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections such as\ndental caries and periodontitis [@marshDentalPlaque2006].\nShortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), a salivary\npellicle adsorbs to the surface of the tooth, in most cases enamel, forming the acquired\ndental pellicle. The pellicle is\ncomprised mainly of proteins and, in addition to protecting the tooth against mechanical\nand chemical decay, provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment [@yaoIdentificationProtein2003].\nShortly after adsorbing to the enamel, early-coloniser species, such as those within genus *Streptococcus* and\n*Actinomyces*, adhere to the pellicle through reversible long-range physicochemical forces and\nirreversible short range cell-host<!--check--> interactions [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once the surface\nhas been populated by the specialists in surface-attachment, other species of bacteria\ncan attach to their surface through cell-cell interactions, allowing adhesion of species\nthat are not otherwise capable of adhering to a surface. After accumulation and multiplication\nof bacteria, this, now, diverse community of is able\nto secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, into their immediate\nenvironment to form a biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].\nThe matrix provides an adaptive advantage\nto the organisms within through resistance to antibiotics and mechanical\nremoval, as well as transporting nutrients from outside the biofilm and facilitating\ndistribution of resources between bacterial communities within the biofilm\n[@petersonViscoelasticityBiofilms2015; @jainIsolationCharacterization2013].\n\nThe composition of a biofilm matrix is largely water (around 90%), with the\nremaining content consisting of microbes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS),\nDNA, RNA, and proteins [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. Biofilms can become susceptible to\ncalcification under certain microenvironmental conditions. These\ninclude an increased concentration of salts and a decrease in statherin\nand proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased\nhydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].\nUnder these conditions, the biofilm environment becomes favourable to increased\nprecipitation and decreased dissolution of calcium phosphate salts within saliva\nand the plaque biofilm.\nThe resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts are the main\ndrivers of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nMineralisation\ngenerally starts from within the biofilm matrix as a result of nucleation, followed\nby mineralisation of the matrix and, subsequently, bacterial cells.\nThe susceptibility of crystallisation in bacteria depends on the composition\nand concentration of membrane-associated components, such as proteolipids and\nphospholipids [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nBinding of calcium to bacterial membranes is facilitated by phospholipid molecules\nwithin the cell membrane,\nfollowed by association of phosphates with the bound calcium to form calcium\nphosphate complexes. These complexes are active in promoting the formation and\ndeposition of hydroxyapatite within biofilms [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\n\nThe primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite (HAP),\noctacalcium phosphate (OCP), whitlockite (WHT), and brushite (BHT). During initial\nmineralisation the main mineral component is BHT, which shifts to HAP in more\nmature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].\nThe exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies by individual due to\nvarious factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].\n\nThe role of bacteria in dental\ncalculus formation is still not clear, and dental calculus formation has been\ninduced in bacteria-free rodents [@glasBiophysicalStudies1962].\nHowever, given the abundance of bacteria present\nwithin human dental plaque, the structure of calculus will reflect the presence of bacteria\nwith human dental calculus containing a heterogenous mineral composition across the biofilm\ndue to the differing mineralisation properties in bacteria, and also directly influences the\nporosity of calculus [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005]. <!-- rephrase: need to emphasise the importance of bacteria in human dental calculus - better proxy -->\n<!-- biofilm maturation and mineralisation -->\n<!-- dental calculus composition and distribution -->\nThe different susceptibility of certain bacteria to mineralise may explain differences\nin bacterial profiles in plaque and dental calculus [@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019]\n\nAttachment of dental calculus to enamel is further solidified by fusion of dental calculus\nwith enamel rods [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\n\nThe organic component of dental calculus consists of proteins and lipids,\nlikely incorporated from bacteria, saliva, and food [@whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nCalculus forming above the gumline (supragingival) has a lower inorganic content\nthan calculus forming below the gumline (subgingival) [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\n\n<!-- oral biofilm models. History, types, etc. -->\nOral biofilm models are commonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy\nof certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010].\nThese are often short-term models grown over a few days, but there also exist longer\nterm models used to develop dental calculus\n[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002]. \nThere are multiple different types of models ranging from simplistic agar plate or\nmultiwell-plate models [@ceriCalgaryBiofilm1999; @extercateAAA2010],\nto more complex setups like the constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) [@petersConstantDepth1988]\nand the multi-station artificial mouth (MAM) [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]. The more\ncomplex models have the benefit of a continuous flow of saliva or saliva-like medium\nand control over the environment, while the multiwell-plate models offer the advantage\nof generating more samples over the same amount of time [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].\nSimplistic models restricted to a select subset of oral bacteria are often more\nreproducible than models using whole saliva, while the latter are more representative\nof the *in vivo* oral microbiome complexity [@roderStudyingBacterial2016; @mcbainBiofilmModels2009].\n\n<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->\n\nWe present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental\ncalculus,\nand provide a method for fundamental research on dental calculus in the past.\nThe need for such a model is warranted by the different questions that are asked by\narchaeologists compared to clinical dentistry. We are interested in learning\nmore about how dietary residues and microremains become trapped in calculus,\nand how the methods we use may inadvertently bias our interpretations; questions\nthat are best addressed in a lab using a model.\nWe used FTIR to verify the mineral composition, and metagenomic classification\nto characterise the bacterial composition, and compared our results against\nmodern and archaeological human dental calculus. We found that\nthe mineral and organic components mimic that of the modern reference calculus\nused for comparison, while the bacterial classification revealed a similar\nbut distinct community structure.<!--The bacterial composition -->\nIn addition to the benefit of increased control over parameters involved in\ncalculus formation and dietary incorporation, our method also provides unlimited\nmaterial for experimentation, rather than using the limited archaeological material\ncurrently available.\n\n\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n## Biofilm growth\n\n<!-- Create table for all samples and indicate which samples underwent DNA, FTIR, etc. -->\n\n\nIn this study we employ a multispecies oral biofilm model following a modified\nprotocol from Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991] and\nShellis [-@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978]. The setup comprises a polypropylene\n24 deepwell PCR plate (KingFisher 97003510) with a lid containing 24 pegs (substrata), which\nis autoclaved at 120&deg;C, 1 bar overpressure, for 20 mins.\n\nThe artificial saliva (AS) is a modified version of the basal medium mucin (BMM)\ndescribed by Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\nIt is a complex medium containing 2.5 g/l partially purified mucin from porcine\nstomach (Type III, Sigma M1778),\n5 g/l trypticase peptone (Roth 2363.1), 10 g/l proteose peptone (Oxoid LP0085),\n5 g/l yeast extract (BD 211921), 2.5 g/l KCl, 0.35 g/l NaCl, 1.8 mmol/l CaCl~2~,\n5.2 mmol/l Na~2~HPO~4~ [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991], 6.4 mmol/l NaHCO~3~\n[@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978], 2.5 mg/l haemin. This is subsequently\nadjusted to pH 7 with NaOH pellets and stirring, autoclaved (15 min, 120&deg;C,\n1 bar overpressure), and supplemented with 5.8 \\(mu\\)mol/l menadione, 5 mmol/l urea,\nand 1 mmol/l arginine [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\n\n<!-- add to protocols.io -->\nFresh whole saliva (WS) for inoculation was provided by a 31-year-old male donor\nwith no history of caries, who abstained from oral hygiene for 24 hours, and no\nfood was consumed two hours prior to donation. No antibiotics were taken up to six\nmonths prior to donation.\nThe saliva was filtered through a sterilised (with bleach) nylon cloth to remove\nparticulates.\nSubstrata were inoculated with 1 ml/well of a two-fold dilution of WS in sterilised\n20% glycerine for four hours at 36&deg;C, to allow attachment of the\nsalivary pellicle and plaque-forming bacteria. After initial inoculation, the\nsubstrata were transferred to a new plate containing 1 ml/well AS and incubated\nat 36&deg;C, 30 rpm. The inoculation process was repeated on days 3 and 5.\nAS was partially refreshed once per day and fully refreshed every three days,\nthroughout the experiment, by transferring the substrata to a new plate containing\nAS. To feed the bacteria, the substrata were transferred to a new plate, containing\n5% (w/v) sucrose, for six minutes twice daily, except on inoculation days\n(days 0, 3, and 5), where the samples only received one sucrose treatment after\ninoculation.\n\nStarch treatments were initiated on day 9 to avoid starch granule counts being\naffected by $alpha$-amylase hydrolysis from inoculation saliva. An $\\alpha$-amylase\nassay confirmed the absence of any $\\alpha$-amylase activity in the system\n[@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].\nStarch treatments replaced sucrose treatments, occurring twice per day\nfor six minutes. The starch treatments involved transferring the substrata to a\nnew plate containing a 0.25% (w/v) starch from potato (Roth 9441.1) solution, a\n0.25% (w/v) starch from wheat (Sigma S5127) solution, and a 0.5% (w/v) mixture of equal\nconcentrations (w/v) wheat and potato. All starch solutions were created in a 5%\n(w/v) sucrose solution. Before transferring biofilm samples to the starch treatments,\nthe starch plates were agitated to keep the starches in suspension in the solutions,\nand during treatments, the rpm was increased to 60.\n\nAfter 15 days, mineralisation was encouraged with a\ncalcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing\n20 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 12 mmol/l NaH~2~PO~4~, 5 mmol/l Na~2~PO~3~F, 500 mmol/l Urea\n[@pearceConcomitantDeposition1987; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991],\nand (0.04 g/l MgCl). The substrata were submerged in 1 ml/well CPMU five times daily,\nevery two hours, for six minutes. During the mineralisation period, starch treatments\nwere reduced to once per day after the five CPMU treatments. This cycle was repeated\nfor 10 days until the end of the experiment on day 24\n(see \\@ref(fig:protocol-fig) for an overview of protocol). A more detailed\nprotocol is available at<!-- protocols.io -->.\n\nAll laboratory work was conducted in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood\nto prevent starch and bacterial contamination.

Samples were analysed\nat the Laboratory for Sedimentary Archaeology, Haifa University. The analysis was\nconducted with a Thermo Nicolet is5 spectrometer in transmission, at 4 cm$^{-1}$\nresolution, with an average of 32 scans between wavenumbers 4000 and 400 cm$^{-1}$.\n\nAnalysis was conducted on 28 biofilm samples from days\n7, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Some samples from the same sampling day had to be\ncombined to provide enough material for analysis. Samples analysed for FTIR\noriginated from a different experiment than the metagenomic samples, following\nthe same protocol (as described above).\nSamples were analysed following the method presented in\n@asscherAtomicDisorder2011. A few $\\mu$g of each sample were repeatedly ground\ntogether with KBr and pressed in a 7 mm die under two tons of pressure using a\nSpecac mini-pellet press (Specac Ltd., GS01152).\nRepeated measurements of the splitting factor were taken after each grind, and a\ngrind curve was produced following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011. Samples were\nground and analysed up to six times (sample suffix a-f) for the grinding curve.\nGrinding curves were prepared for samples from days 16, 20, and 24. No grind\ncurves were produced for samples from days 7 and 12. These were largely composed\nof organics and proteins, and did not form enough carbonated hydroxtapatite for\nanalysis. The splitting factor of carbonate hydroxyapatite was calculated using\na macro script, following @weinerStatesPreservation1990, by dividing the sum of\nthe height of the absorptions at 603 cm$^{-1}$ and 567 cm$^{-1}$ in the height\nof the valley between them. Following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011 we plotted the\nIRSF against the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main absorption at 1035,\nand compared our grinding curves to the ones produced by @asscherAtomicDisorder2011.\n\nSplitting factors of the doublet, and FWHM of the main PO~4~ peak at 1040 were\ncalculated from the grinding measurements, and plotted against each other to\ncreate grinding curves to explore crystallinity (crystal size) and the order and\ndisorder. Disorder is a steep slope and large FWHM.\n\n## Statistics\n\n<!-- R packages used -->\nStatistical analysis was conducted in R Statistical Software R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\n(Vigorous Calisthenics) [@Rbase].

Our proposed use of the model is to address\na variety of research questions related to dietary information extracted from\ndental calculus, in both modern and ancient samples.\nFor that to be feasible, the model needs to act as a viable proxy to\ndental calculus grown under natural conditions, i.e., in the human mouth.\nIt needs, as much as possible, to mimic the diversity and complexity of the\nnatural oral microbiome, while also offering control over factors such as dietary\ninput, growth conditions, and replicability within and between experiments.\nHere, we assessed the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus\nusing metagenomic classification and FTIR analysis to explore the bacterial\nand mineral composition, and compare with oral reference samples.\n\n## Microbiome\n\n<!-- diversity and complexity within experiment and compared to oral references -->\nThere is a loss of diversity from donated saliva to model calculus, and\nwhen compared to oral reference samples, which is a common limitation in\nbiofilm models [@edlundBiofilmModel2013; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013].\nThe donated saliva for the experiment\nhad a lower diversity than the reference saliva samples, and may have contributed\nto a lower diversity in experiment samples. Consequently, there is also\na lower diversity and richness when compared to other modern oral reference samples,\nincluding oral mucosa, saliva, plaque, and calculus<!--alpha-div figs-->.\nModel calculus samples\nprimarily consist of species within the genera *Veillonella* and *Enterococcus*,\nwith more limited contributions from *Streptococcus* and *Prevotella*. The core\nmicrobiomes of oral reference samples have similar levels of streptococci,\nbut a much more even distribution of species from *Actinomyces*, *Capnocytophaga*,\n*Fusobacterium*, and more<!-- Figure ref to pie charts -->.\n\n<!-- community profiles compared to oral references -->\nMedium samples from early in the experiment have similar species profiles\nto the donated saliva, but gradually diverge over the course of the experiment,\nas seen in the increasing separation of samples on PC1 in Figure<!-- ref to sPCA figure -->.\nThis may be caused by the growth conditions provided by the experimental setup,\nwhich may not sufficiently mimic the oral environment, allowing different oral\nspecies to thrive that do not normally thrive in the natural oral environment.\nEspecially *Enterococcus* spp. seemed to thrive later in the experiment, at the\nexpense of more fastidious species like *Capnocytophaga* and *Neisseria* spp.,\nwhich require an atmosphere with at least 5% carbon dioxide to thrive, so the model\nmay have a low carbon dioxide atmosphere [@tonjumNeisseria2017]. Early colonisers,\nincluding the aforementioned *Capnocytophaga* and *Neisseria* spp., as well as\n*Actinomyces*, were dominant in oral reference samples and deficient in model\ncalculus samples, as well as the comparative *in vitro* model.\nNot only is there a decreased species diversity between model and reference samples,\nbut also a loss of diversity in aerotolerance. Of the dominant species in the model,\nmost are either anaerobes or facultative anaerobes, predominantly Gram-negative\n*Veillonella* and *Prevotella*, and Gram-positive *Enterococcus*.\nSpecies within predominantly aerobic genera, such as *Neisseria*, *Rothia*, and\n*Ottowia*, are deficient in the model compared to the donated saliva\nand other oral samples<!--PC loading plots-->, suggesting a shift from a largely\naerotolerant profile to an anaerobic profile during the experiment.\nWhile our model is not set up as an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to\nhave outcompeted aerobes and, to some extent, facultative anaerobes.\nThis is likely a result of communities of bacteria within the biofilm creating\nfavourable microenvironments facilitated by the protective properties of the\nbiofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016; @edlundUncoveringComplex2018].\n*Capnocytophaga* and *Actinomyces* spp. are predominantly (facultative) anaerobes,\nso their deficiency must be attributed to different reasons.\nThe highest log-fold changes\nbetween model calculus and other samples were seen in *E. faecalis*, *E. durans*,\nand *E. casseliflavus*, and contributed\nmost to the unique clustering of model calculus on PC1<!-- sPCA and DA figures-->.\n*E. faecalis* was also\nabundant in the comparative *in vitro* biofilm study<!-- large species plot-->.\n*Enterococcus* spp. out-competing other species may be a problem in\nmodel biofilm studies, but more comparative studies are needed to confirm\n(and there are limited WGS studies to use as a comparison).\n\nModel calculus and the modern reference calculus clustered separately in the sPCA\nanalysis. This may be due to human variation, as there can be large differences\nin the oral microbiome of two individuals, and modern reference samples were taken\nfrom the same geographical origin (as was the donor saliva for the model, which\nwas taken from a different geographical origin). One of the main drivers of\ndifferences in species profiles has been previously shown to be individual\nvariation, even more so than pathological condition [@velskoAncientDental2022a].\nWhether or not distinct microbial profiles will affect the retention of\ndietary incorporation remains to be seen, and likely depends on the role bacteria\nplay in the incorporation and retention of dietary compounds and microremains\nwithin a biofilm. Samples within the experiment were quite consistent allowing\nthis to be explored further.\n\n\nSpecies related to caries, such as *Steptococcus mutans* and members of\nthe *Lactobacillus* genus, were deficient in both model calculus samples\nand oral reference samples. Both are integral in creating an acidic environment\nthat favours demineralisation and inhibits mineralisation, so there absence is\nexpected in a calculus model\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @edlundBiofilmModel2013].\nThe abundance of *Veillonella* and *Prevotella* spp. could suggest a pathogenic\npotential within the model biofilm, as these are commonly reported as opportunistic\nor accessory pathogens in periodontal disease\n[@zhouVeillonellaeBridging2021; @tettPrevotellaDiversity2021].\n\n## Mineralisation\n\n<!-- mineralisation process - FTIR - gradual mineralisation -->\nFTIR analysis allowed us to address the mineralisation process of the model.\nThe results showed an increasing mineral composition over the course of the\nexperiment as the model biofilm matured.\nSamples taken early in the experiment, on day 7 and 12, had a high lipid and\nprotein content consistent with the presence of microbial DNA and RNA within\na matrix of extracellular polysaccharides [@jainIsolationCharacterization2013].\nThe high water content, indicated by\nthe O--H stretch, is also consistent with a biofilm, which is around 90%\nwater [@bergerOralBiofilms2018]. As the samples mature over the course of the\nexperiment, the ratio of proteins\nand lipids to phosphates shift from predominance of organic content to\ninorganic content in the form of carbonated hydroxyapatite<!--fig reference-->.\n\nThe artificial samples from day 24 are consistent with spectra of carbonated\nhydroxyapatite and resemble both the modern reference samples and\nthe archaeological sample in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper\nslope in the grind curve plots of the archaeological sample may suggest that the\ncrystals in archaeological samples are larger than in the model calculus\n[@fig-grind-curve]. A possible explanation is that\nthe inorganic crystals within archaeological calculus have had more time to expand\ninto the space left by degraded organic matter [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010].\nIt may also have been an unusually crystallised sample; as we only analysed a\nsingle archaeological sample, and more modern and archaeological samples are\nneeded to see if the high level of crystallinity is consistent in archaeological\ncalculus, and if the level of crystallinity of the model calulus is more comparable\nto modern reference samples.\nThe grinding curves for days 16, 20, and 24 were very similar, suggesting\nthat the CPMU solution, which is introduced on day 16 to promote mineralisation,\nmay not have much of an effect.\n\nAlthough there were differences in species profiles between modern and model\ncalculus, the mineral composition of the end results were similar, reinforcing\nthe idea that, under the right circumstances, most bacteria will mineralise\n[@moorerCalcificationCariogenic1993]. Even occurring without one of the most\nwell-known biomineraliser, *Corynebacterium matruchotii*, which was deficient in model,\nand was the strongest discriminator of oral samples from model samples<!--sPCA loadings fig-->.\nIt may also suggest that, while bacteria\nare integral in the formation of dental calculus, and inevitably serve as part\nof the structure that dental calculus is built upon [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005],\nthe species composition of the biofilm communities may be less important. And that\nmineralisation may largely be a chemical process (catalysed by biological factors)\n[@omelonReviewPhosphate2013].\n\n## Replicability\n<!-- replicability within the experiment -->\nThe model calculus displayed similar species diversity and richness indices across\nall samples, indicating a high level of replicability between samples in the\nexperimental run, despite larger variation between medium samples<!-- figure reference -->.\nBoth sPCA analyses conducted with experiment only samples and with oral\nreference samples also cluster model calculus closely together.\nIt remains to be seen whether the replicability within the experiment\nalso scales up to between-experiment replicability.\nThe variation in mineral composition was initially high in early model biofilm\nsamples from days 7 and 12, but starting day 16 the variation decreased, and\ncontinued to decrease until day 24. The model calculus samples from day 24\nwere largely similar in composition as observed in the FTIR spectra<!--fig ref-->.\nThe use of a simple multiwell plate setup allows us to [submit] many samples\nto the same conditions which promotes replicability between samples<!--cite-->.\nWhile the experimental conditions, including the dietary input, are kept constant,\nand the mineral and bacterial profiles are similar between samples, there is\nstill a relatively large variation in starch retention in the model calculus\n[@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].\n\n<!-- secondary findings -->\n\n<!-- Scientific findings as extension of previous work -->\n<!-- How this engineering will facilitate future research -->\nThere are many biofilm models to choose from, so developing a new protocol may\nseem counter-productive; however, few are developed for long-term\ngrowth and even fewer for mineralisation. One of the exceptions involves a complex setup\nthat is likely unfeasible to most archaeological research [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\nOur model uses a simplified high-throughput setup more commonly seen in shorter-term\nbiofilm models that mainly focus on dental plaque [@extercateAAA2010; @tianUsingDGGE2010].\nAs shown in a previous study, calculus and plaque have distinct microbial profiles\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019], so their applicability to explore archaeological\nquestions on dental calculus are limited. Clinical studies are also largely focused\non short-term effects of anti-microbial treatments and inhibition of biofilm\nformation<!--citations-->, while archaeologists are more interested in questions\nrelated to ... Questions, we believe, can to some extent be answered using an\noral biofilm model.\nOur previous work has shown that, like dental calculus, the model calculus is\nable to trap and retain dietary starches, admittedly with some variability\nbetween samples [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].\n\n## Limitations\n\nA well-known limitation of biofilm models is the difficulty in capturing the\ndiversity and complexity of the natural oral biome. Diversity and complexity may\nbe represented as interspecies communities and complex metabolic dependencies between\norganisms within the communitues, or as an environmental complexity determined by\nnutrient availability, host immune-responses to biofilms, and fluctuating\nmicroenvironments across the biofilm in response to these factors\n[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013].\nOur single-donor approach may have affected diversity of model. The donated saliva\nhad a lower mean alpha-diversity than other saliva samples. Although benefit of\nsingle donor means maintaining the integrity of the original bacterial community.\nThere are benefits and trade-offs for both pooled and single-donor saliva\n[@edlundBiofilmModel2013].\n\n\n<!-- Findings' scientific implications -->\n\n<!-- Forward-looking statements about the field as a whole -->\n\n<!-- a summary/importance of the engineering aspect of the work -->\n\n<!-- How it facilitates scientific research -->\n\n<!-- limitations of the platform show which questions would be unanswered -->\n\nResearch relating to $alpha$-amylase activity and its effect on the oral biome\n(whether dietary or otherwise) will require addition of amylase to the model during\nthe experiment, as it is not present naturally in our current setup\n(as shown in @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022).\nOur model has no renewable source for $alpha$-amylase once the inoculations\nhave been completed. There are streptococci present in the model, which are known\nfor their ability to bind amylase [@nikitkovaStarchBiofilms2013]; however,\nit is unclear whether the correct strains are present in our model, and if they are,\nwhy they are not binding $alpha$-amylase provided by the saliva inoculate.\nThis could\nbe due to the frequency of medium replacement potentially clearing out all of the\nunbound amylase every time medium is replaced.\nOur current model does not contain serum, which may be\ncontributing to the deficiency of slow-growing fastidious organisms [@tianUsingDGGE2010].\n\nBiofilms were grown in a standard shaking incubator, rather than a incubator specific\nto cell cultures. The lack of complex environmental control may cause the model\nto deviate from its natural growth over the 24 days that the experiment\nis run, due to a lack of precise control over physiological conditions.\n\nThere is also a possibility of contamination in the model. While the CPMU solution was\nprepared under sterile conditions, the solution itself was not autoclaved, and may\nhave been a source of contamination. This is further ... by the fact that none of\nthe medium samples taken after the introduction of CPMU (day 14) made it past\nauthentication in the metagenomic analysis, and that a large portion of the\nsources of many samples were estimated to be from indoor air and surface samples\n<!-- sourcetracker plot ref -->.\n\nAnother limitation involves the information on aerotolerance of the identified\nspecies. Species-level aerotolerance was collected from BacDive<!--reference, url, etc.--> and,\nat the time of writing<!--or rather, last time the manuscript was rendered-->,\n55.9%\nspecies were missing aerotolerance values. This was mitigated by aggregating genus-level\ntolerances to missing species, and may have some errors (although unlikely to make\nany significant changes).\n\n<!-- limitations to biofilm models -->\n\n<!-- Is it possible that the mixture of sucrose in the starch solutions eliminates the need to feed on starch? -->\n\n<!-- modern calculus references samples were all from the same geographic origin -->\n\n<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->\n\n## Future work\n\nOur goals for additional validation measures involve functional profiles of bacterial,\nto see if metabolic behaviour\nof bacteria is consistent with *in vivo* conditions, and whether this is\naffected by the presence/absence of amylase.\nFurther protocol optimisation will also be necessary to address some of the\nlimitations of our current model. We may need to reduce the frequency of\nmedium replacement (currently every three days) to help promote the\ngrowth of slower growing organisms and limit generalists such as enterococci.\nMore infrequent medium replacement would facilitate slow-growing bacteria in\nestablishing their metabolic relationships, allowing the byproducts of some species\nto become abundant enough for others that depend on these to grow [@marshDentalPlaque2005].\nFinally, if the within-experiment replicability is also present between\nexperiments.\nAn important question to address is what role bacteria play in the incorporation\nand retention of dietary microremains, and whether differing bacterial profiles\naffects the dietary incorporation and retention within the biofilm. Regardless,\nthe apparent replicability of our current setup is a promising result.\n\nThe calculus model we have presented has many potential benefits within archaeological\nresearch. It can be used to test many fundamental assumptions we have about\nthe process of inclusion and subsequent extraction of various information about\nhealth and diet from archaeological dental calculus.\nHow our current methods for exploring diet and health may be biased.\nHow different methods of food processing in the past may reflect the picture\nwe get from the samples we analyse.\nThis method can be used for a wide range of methods-testing (e.g. DNA, proteomics, etc.) \nas well as training for various sampling methods, and testing decontamination protocols,\nwithout using up limited supplies of archaeological resources.\n\n<!-- ultimately we are left with more questions than answers, but isn't that the \nbeauty of exploratory science? -->\n\n\n\n# References {-}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
