  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As high-throughput sequencing platforms produce longer and longer reads, sequences generated from short inserts, such as those obtained from fossil and degraded material, are increasingly expected to contain adapter sequences. Efficient adapter trimming algorithms are also needed to process the growing amount of data generated per sequencing run. FINDINGS: We introduce AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval v1, which introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput, through the use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD; SSE1 and SSE2) instructions and multi-threading support, (ii) the ability to handle datasets containing reads or read-pairs with different adapters or adapter pairs, (iii) simultaneous demultiplexing and adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to reconstruct adapter sequences from paired-end reads for poorly documented data sets, and (v) native gzip and bzip2 support. CONCLUSIONS: We show that AdapterRemoval v2 compares favorably with existing tools, while offering superior throughput to most alternatives examined here, both for single and multi-threaded operations.},

  abstract = {The importance of commensal microbes for human health is increasingly recognized, yet the impacts of evolutionary changes in human diet and culture on commensal microbiota remain almost unknown. Two of the greatest dietary shifts in human evolution involved the adoption of carbohydrate-rich Neolithic (farming) diets (beginning approximately 10,000 years before the present) and the more recent advent of industrially processed flour and sugar (in approximately 1850). Here, we show that calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) on ancient teeth preserves a detailed genetic record throughout this period. Data from 34 early European skeletons indicate that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming shifted the oral microbial community to a disease-associated configuration. The composition of oral microbiota remained unexpectedly constant between Neolithic and medieval times, after which (the now ubiquitous) cariogenic bacteria became dominant, apparently during the Industrial Revolution. Modern oral microbiotic ecosystems are markedly less diverse than historic populations, which might be contributing to chronic oral (and other) disease in postindustrial lifestyles.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is caused by a highly complex consortium of bacteria that establishes as biofilms in subgingival pockets. It is a disease that occurs worldwide and its consequences are a major health concern. Investigations in situ are not possible and the bacterial community varies greatly between patients and even within different loci. Due to the high complexity of the consortium and the availability of samples, a clear definition of the pathogenic bacteria and their mechanisms of pathogenicity are still not available. In the current study we addressed the need of a defined model system by advancing our previously described subgingival biofilm model towards a bacterial composition that reflects the one observed in diseased sites of patients and analysed the structure of these biofilms. RESULTS: We further developed the growth media by systematic variation of key components resulting in improved stability and the firm establishment of spirochetes in the 10-species subgingival Zurich biofilm model. A high concentration of heat-inactivated human serum allowed the best proliferation of the used species. Therefore we further investigated these biofilms by analysing their structure by confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The species showed mutual interactions as expected from other studies. The abundances of all organisms present in this model were determined by microscopic counting following species-specific identification by both fluorescence in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence. The newly integrated treponemes were the most abundant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 50\% of heat-inactivated human serum used in the improved growth medium resulted in significantly thicker and more stable biofilms, and the quantitative representation of the used species represents the in vivo community of periodontitis patients much closer than in biofilms grown in the two media with less or no human serum. The appearance of T. denticola, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia in the top layer of the biofilms, and the high abundance of T. denticola, reflects well the microbial situation observed at diseased sites. The improved model biofilms will allow further investigations of interactions between individual species and of the effects of atmospheric or nutritional changes, as well as interactions with tissue cells.},

These changes in the carbonate hydroxyapatite structure and composition can affect the signals embedded in the mineral phase, such as migration behavior, age of the specimen and the reconstruction of past environments. Mineral preservation state can be assessed using infrared spectroscopy which provides information on crystal disorder at the atomic level and mineral composition. Here we present a new approach to evaluate carbonate hydroxyapatite atomic disorder using infrared spectroscopy and the standard KBr sample mounting method. We show that by repeated grinding of the sample and then plotting the infrared splitting factor against the width of the major phosphate absorption peak after each grinding, grinding curves with well defined trend lines can be obtained. The offsets between curves reflect differences in atomic disorder. We show that grinding curve offsets can be used to evaluate the state of preservation of bone, dentine and enamel mineral.},

  abstract = {Biogenic carbonate hydroxyapatite crystals are inherently disordered at the atomic level due mainly to the substitutions of various ions in the crystal structure, and, in the case of the bone family of materials, to the fact that these very small crystals have a very large surface-to-bulk ratio. Characterization of the extent of disorder is of much interest, as this relates to the stability and hence solubility of the crystals. Here the infrared spectrometry grinding curve approach developed for calcite, is adapted to carbonate hydroxyapatites. The infrared splitting factor is plotted against the full width at half height of the strong phosphate absorption peak as a function of increased grinding of the sample. By doing so, the contribution of particle size to the shape of the peaks is better separated from the contribution of atomic disorder to peak shape. It is shown that differences in disorder exist between dentine, cementum, and bone crystals which could reflect crystal size and/or atomic defects within the crystal. It is als shown that systematic differences exist between enamel samples from different taxa, which we assume only reflects atomic disorder differences within these large crystals. The method can be used to characterize atomic disorder in natural hydroxyapatites, as well as in the many different types of synthetic hydroxyapatites used for biomedical implants.},

  abstract = {Dental calculus has proven to contain a wealth of information on the dietary habits of past populations. These insights have, to a large extent, been obtained by the extraction and identification of starch granules contained within the mineralised dental plaque from a wide range of regions and time periods. The scope of previous studies have been limited to microfossil extraction and identification to reconstruct dietary preferences from the archaeological record, and few studies have attempted to address the biases of starch retention in dental calculus. Those that have considered this problem have been limited to in vivo studies on modern humans and non-human primates. Here, we present a multispecies oral biofilm model, which allows experimental research on starch incorporation and retention to be conducted on in vitro dental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. The biofilms were exposed to treatment solutions with known quantities of dietary starches (wheat and potato) during the 25~days growth period. After this, the starch granules were extracted from the mature biofilm (by dissolution in EDTA), and counted. We show that the granule counts extracted from the model dental calculus represented a low proportion (ranging from 0.06\% to 0.16\%) of the total number of granules exposed to the biofilms throughout the experiment. Additionally, we found that the ratios of granule sizes from the extracted starch granules differed from the original treatment solutions, with large granules ({$>$}20~μm) consistently being under-represented. We also found a positive correlation between the absolute granule counts and dry-weight of the biofilm (r = 0.659, 90\%CI[0.463, 0.794]), meaning the absolute quantity of starch granules will increase as the size of the calculus deposit increases. A similar, but weaker correlation was found between the concentration (count per mg) of granules and dry-weight (r = 0.3, 90\%CI[0.0618, 0.506]). Our results complement and reinforce previous in vivo studies suggesting that dental calculus presents a very small, and partly biased picture of the original dietary intake of starches, with an over-representation of plants producing granules smaller than 20~μm in size. The experimental model presented here is well-suited to address the need for further validation of methods and biases associated with dietary research on dental calculus.}

  abstract = {Dental calculus is an excellent source of information on the dietary patterns of past populations, including consumption of plant-based items. The detection of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a population. We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore potential relationships between pathological conditions/lesions and the presence of alkaloids. We also explored other factors potentially affecting the detection of alkaloids, including sample weight and skeletal preservation. Dental calculus was sampled and analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid. By detecting these compounds we are able to show the consumption of tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition. Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 60\% of individuals with at least one visible pipe notch. We find some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection of alkaloids and salicylic acid, with higher quantities of compounds extracted from well-preserved individuals, and also observe a relationship between weight of the calculus sample and raw quantity of the detected compounds, and we were able to detect alkaloids in samples as small as 2 mg. We found correlations between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids.We show that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward with this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations on different parts of the dentition. Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates the many benefits of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been ingested as medicine or diet, or consumed in a different manner. This method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation, such as rural populations, children and women.},

However, there is growing evidence for use of locally available wild plants from an increasing number of pre-agrarian sites, suggesting broad ecological knowledge. The extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of raw material preparation through chewing.},

Bacterial composition may be affected by age, oral health, diet, and geography, although information about the natural variation found in the general public is still lacking. In this study, citizen-scientists used a crowdsourcing model to obtain oral bacterial composition data from guests at the Denver Museum of Nature \& Science to determine if previously suspected oral microbiome associations with an individual’s demographics, lifestyle, and/or genetics are robust and generalizable enough to be detected within a general population. Consistent with past research, we found bacterial composition to be more diverse in youth microbiomes when compared to adults. Adult oral microbiomes were predominantly impacted by oral health habits, while youth microbiomes were impacted by biological sex and weight status. The oral pathogen               Treponema               was detected more commonly in adults without recent dentist visits and in obese youth. Additionally, oral microbiomes from participants of the same family were more similar to each other than to oral microbiomes from non-related individuals. These results suggest that previously reported oral microbiome associations are observable in a human population containing the natural variation commonly found in the general public. Furthermore, these results support the use of crowdsourced data as a valid methodology to obtain community-based microbiome data.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk}

However, much of what is known about the behavior of oral species to date derives from pure culture approaches and the studies combining several cultivated species, which likely does not fully reflect their function in complex microbial communities. It has been shown in studies with a limited number of cultivated species that early oral biofilm development occurs in a successional manner and that continuous low pH can lead to an enrichment of aciduric species. Observations that in vitro grown plaque biofilm microcosms can maintain similar pH profiles in response to carbohydrate addition as plaque in vivo suggests a complex microbial community can be established in the laboratory. In light of this, our primary goal was to develop a robust in vitro biofilm-model system from a pooled saliva inoculum in order to study the stability, reproducibility, and development of the oral microbiome, and its dynamic response to environmental changes from the community to the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Background: Dental plaque is composed of hundreds of bacterial taxonomic units and represents one of the most diverse and stable microbial ecosystems associated with the human body. Taxonomic composition and functional capacity of mature plaque is gradually shaped during several stages of community assembly via processes such as co-aggregation, competition for space and resources, and by bacterially produced reactive agents. Knowledge on the dynamics of assembly within complex communities is very limited and derives mainly from studies composed of a limited number of bacterial species. To fill current knowledge gaps, we applied parallel metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses during assembly and maturation of an in vitro oral biofilm. This model system has previously demonstrated remarkable reproducibility in taxonomic composition across replicate samples during maturation. Results: Time course analysis of the biofilm maturation was performed by parallel sampling every 2–3 h for 24 h for both DNA and RNA. Metagenomic analyses revealed that community taxonomy changed most dramatically between three and six hours of growth when pH dropped from 6.5 to 5.5. By applying comparative metatranscriptome analysis we could identify major shifts in overall community activities between six and nine hours of growth when pH dropped below 5.5, as 29,015 genes were significantly up- or down- expressed. Several of the differentially expressed genes showed unique activities for individual bacterial genomes and were associated with pyruvate and lactate metabolism, two-component signaling pathways, production of antibacterial molecules, iron sequestration, pH neutralization, protein hydrolysis, and surface attachment. Our analysis also revealed several mechanisms responsible for the niche expansion of the cariogenic pathogen Lactobacillus fermentum. Conclusion: It is highly regarded that acidic conditions in dental plaque cause a net loss of enamel from teeth. Here, as pH drops below 5.5 pH to 4.7, we observe blooms of cariogenic lactobacilli, and a transition point of many bacterial gene expression activities within the community. To our knowledge, this represents the first study of the assembly and maturation of a complex oral bacterial biofilm community that addresses gene level functional responses over time.},

Here we show that certain alkaloids, nicotine in this case, can also be trapped and preserved in ancient dental calculus. We present Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) results of analyses of ten archaeological calculus samples from eight individuals from Central California. Two samples tested positive for the presence of nicotine, including one from an individual buried with a pipe. UPLC-MS analyses of dental calculus could provide an alternative means to trace the spread and consumption of tobacco and other plants with distinctive alkaloid products in ancient societies. As shown here for the first time in ancient samples, the ability to detect nicotine alkaloids in calculus has enormous potential to help us better understand the consumption of intoxicant plants by ancient humans on the individual level, for example by giving us the ability to test assumptions about the age, sex, and status of individual tobacco users in the past.},

  abstract = {The oral cavity is a heterogeneous environment, varying in factors such as pH, oxygen levels, and salivary flow. These factors affect the microbial community composition and distribution of species in dental plaque, but it is not known how well these patterns are reflected in archaeological dental calculus. In most archaeological studies, a single sample of dental calculus is studied per individual and is assumed to represent the entire oral cavity. However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500–5000 BP). Interindividual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intraindividual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples is likely of postmortem origin, demonstrating the importance of including environmental controls or additional lines of biomolecular evidence in dietary interpretations.}

  abstract = {In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on ThermanoxTM coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA–DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15\% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5\%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.},

Finally, we highlight the value of an ecological perspective in the study of the emergent properties of biofilms, which enables an appreciation of the ecological success of biofilms as habitat formers and, more generally, as a bacterial lifestyle.},

However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis.

Oral health examination included panoramic radiography. Results The concentrations of MMP-8, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in saliva were higher in subjects with generalized periodontitis than in controls. Of the tested salivary markers, MMP-8 was the only marker capable of differentiating subjects with severe alveolar bone loss from those with slight bone loss (p {$<$} 0.001). The association between the salivary MMP-8 levels and periodontitis remained significant after the adjustment with age, gender and smoking. In addition, significant correlations were found between the tested markers and periodontal parameters. Conclusion Enzymes and end-products of type I collagen degradation have different associations with each other and with periodontal status that may reflect their roles in the cascade leading to alveolar bone loss. MMP-8 is a strong biomarker candidate for detecting alveolar bone destruction.},

  abstract = {Dental calculus has been implicated in the aetiology of several periodontal conditions. Its prevention and removal are therefore desirable clinical goals. While it is known that calculus is very variable in chemical composition, crystallinity and crystallite size little is known about site specific variability within a dentition and between individuals. With this in mind, a study was undertaken to investigate the comparative site specific nature and composition of human dental supra-gingival dental calculus obtained from 66 male patients visiting for their dental check-up using fluorescent X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The supra-gingival dental calculus formed on the lingual surfaces of lower anterior teeth and the buccal surfaces of upper molar teeth were classified into four types based on calcium phosphate phases present. There was significant difference in composition of the crystal phase types between lower and upper teeth ( p {$<$} 0.01). There was no significant difference in crystal size between dental calculus on anterior or molar teeth of all samples. The degree of crystallinity of dental calculus formed on the upper molar teeth was higher than that formed on the lower anterior teeth ( p {$<$} 0.01). The CO32À contents in dental calculus formed on the lower anterior teeth were higher than on upper molar teeth ( p {$<$} 0.05) which might explain the difference in crystallinity. Magnesium and Si contents and Ca:P ratio on the other hand showed no significant difference between lower and upper teeth. It was concluded that the crystal phases, crystallinity and CO32À contents of human dental supra-gingival dental calculus is related to its location in the mouth.},

Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein β-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (eighth century BC to nineteenth century AD) in England, as well as 14 dental calculus samples from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterize the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detect proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. This study demonstrates that proteomic approaches can robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are typically under-represented due to their poor macroscopic preservation.},

The major constituent of biofilm other than bacterial cells is the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, which is secreted by the bacterial cells themselves. Physical properties of biofilms such as attachment, mechanical strength, antibiotic resistance can be attributed to EPS matrix. Molecular phylogeny confirmed these two isolates as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. It was observed that cell attachment in both the strains was maximal when xylose was used as the sole carbon source. The EPS characterization result indicated the presence of a macromolecular complex constituting of carbohydrate, protein, lipids and nucleic acids. Test for biofilm formation in the presence of metal salts of iron and zinc showed moderate to high inhibition of biofilm formation. However, calcium, iron and copper have been found to enhance biofilm growth significantly. There was more than 50 \% increase in biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa with an increase in calcium concentration up to 80 ppm (Two tailed t-test P{$<$}0.05), whereas ≥ 15 \% increase in biofilm growth by B. subtilis was observed in the presence of 80 ppm of calcium. However, variations were significant (Two way ANOVA, P{$<$}0.01) between different metals in different concentrations.

We evaluated the preservation of human oral microbiome patterns in historic samples and compared the microbial composition of historic dental calculus, modern human dental plaque, modern human dental calculus samples and burial soil microbiota. Overall, the results showed that the majority of microbial DNA in historic dental calculus originated from the oral microbiome with little impact of the burial environment. Good preservation of ancient DNA in historical dental calculus samples has provided reliable insight into the composition of the oral microbiome of postmedieval Latvian individuals. The relative stability of the classifiable oral microbiome composition was observed. Significant differences between the microbiome profiles of dental calculus and dental plaque samples were identified, suggesting microbial adaptation to a specific human body environment.},

  abstract = {Starch granules and phytoliths trapped in dental calculus preserve a record of plant consumption. Analysis of these microscopic plant remains has increased in popularity in recent years, providing information on diet that complements dental microwear and stable isotope studies. However, it is unclear how accurately these microremains reflect plant consumption. This study examines how well starch granules and phytoliths in dental calculus from a living population (the Twe) with a well-documented diet capture the range and intensity of plant consumption. We find that plant microremains are a poor predictor of plant consumption on an individual level, but may provide a good signal of plant consumption across a population, as well as evidence for plant processing in the mouth. This is the first study to test how well plant microremains in dental calculus reflect plant consumption in a population with a known diet. Results from this project have implications for interpreting plant microremain data from archaeological dental calculus samples.},

  abstract = {Saliva has attracted attention as a diagnostic fluid due to the association of oral microbiota with systemic diseases. However, the lack of standardised methods for saliva collection has led to the slow uptake of saliva in microbiome research. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the potential effects on salivary microbiome profiles using different methods of saliva collection, storage and gDNA extraction. Three types of saliva fractions were collected from healthy individuals with or without the gDNA stabilising buffer. Subsequently, three types of gDNA extraction methods were evaluated to determine the gDNA extraction efficiencies from saliva samples. The purity of total bacterial gDNA was evaluated using the ratio of human β-globin to bacterial 16S rRNA PCR while 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was carried out to identify the bacterial profiles present in these samples. The quantity and quality of extracted gDNA were similar among all three gDNA extraction methods and there were no statistically significant differences in the bacterial profiles among different saliva fractions at the genus-level of taxonomic classification. In conclusion, saliva sampling, processing and gDNA preparation do not have major influence on microbiome profiles.},

In this article we define the notion of “sampling fraction” and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

To better understand the variability in protein results from dental calculus, we analysed 21 samples from three Roman-period populations to compare: 1) the quantity of extracted protein; 2) the number of mass spectral queries; and 3) the number of peptide spectral matches and protein identifications. We found little correlation between the quantity of calculus analysed and total protein identifications, as well as no systematic trends between site location and protein preservation. We identified a wide range of individual variability, which may be associated with the mechanisms of calculus formation and/or post-depositional contamination, in addition to taphonomic factors. Our results suggest dental calculus is indeed a stable, long-term reservoir of proteins as previously reported, but further systematic studies are needed to identify mechanisms associated with protein entrapment and survival in dental calculus.},

  abstract = {The diet of prehistoric humans in the Qijia period (4,400–3,500~BP) was significantly changed by the advent of dry agriculture and food globalization. However, it is yet to be proven whether wild plants were exploited despite the cultivation of millet, and whether wheat crops, cattle, and sheep originating from southwestern Asia were adopted into the regional human diet. This study presents stable isotope, starch grain, and phytolith analyses of 24 human teeth from the Lajia site in Qinghai, which is a representative Qijia culture settlement site. The carbon and nitrogen isotope results show that the subjects primarily ate C4 plants and had a high protein diet. Starch grain and phytolith results showed that the inhabitants consumed broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), Triticeae, tubers and roots, along with other Pooideae and Poaceae plants. This data proves that although broomcorn and foxtail millet formed the mainstay of the Qijia diet, it also included a wide range of plants, such as the tribe Triticeae, tubers and roots, which would have been foraged rather than grown. Compared with the other three contemporaneous sites in Northern China, the proportion of millet starches was highest at the Lajia site, while the type and proportion of foraged plants were the lowest. This was probably because of the arid environment in the region, which could not have supported sufficient plant resources for foraging, which in turn might have led to enhanced millet cultivation and/or a greater reliance on hunting. No wheat or barley traces were found in human teeth in Lajia, and the high proportion of nitrogen was possibly related to the consumption of sheep because sheep bones were found in a zooarchaeological study. This study enhances our understanding of the subsistence strategies present in Qijia culture and of prehistoric food globalization, which is of pivotal significance for a deeper understanding of interactions between east and west Asia during the Neolithic and Bronze ages.}

Biofilms are highly structured and spatially organized, and are often composed of consortia of interacting microorganisms, termed microbial communities, the properties of which are more than the sum of the component species. Microbial gene expression alters markedly in biofilms; organisms communicate by gene transfer and by secretion of diffusible signalling molecules. Cells in biofilms are less susceptible to antimicrobial agents. Aim and Materials \& Methods: To comprehensively review the literature to determine whether dental plaque displays properties consistent with those of a typical biofilm and microbial community. Results: Novel microscopic and molecular techniques have demonstrated that plaque has a structured architecture with an extracellular matrix, and a diverse composition (around 50\% of cells are unculturable). The constituent species communicate by gene transfer, by secreted peptides (Gram-positive bacteria) and autoinducer-2 (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). These organisms are functionally organized for increased metabolic efficiency, greater resistance to stress and for enhanced virulence. Plaque formation has direct and indirect effects on gene expression. Conclusion: Dental plaque displays properties that are typical of biofilms and microbial communities in general, a clinical consequence of which is a reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial agents as well as pathogenic synergism.},

  abstract = {Dental plaque is a structurally- and functionally-organized biofilm. Plaque forms in an ordered way and has a diverse microbial composition that, in health, remains relatively stable over time (microbial homeostasis). The predominant species from diseased sites are different from those found in healthy sites, although the putative pathogens can often be detected in low numbers at normal sites. In dental caries, there is a shift toward community dominance by acidogenic and acidtolerating species such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, although other species with relevant traits may be involved. Strategies to control caries could include inhibition of biofilm development (e.g. prevention of attachment of cariogenic bacteria, manipulation of cell signaling mechanisms, delivery of effective antimicrobials, etc.), or enhancement of the host defenses. Additionally, these more conventional approaches could be augmented by interference with the factors that enable the cariogenic bacteria to escape from the normal homeostatic mechanisms that restrict their growth in plaque and out compete the organisms associated with health. Evidence suggests that regular conditions of low pH in plaque select for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Therefore, the suppression of sugar catabolism and acid production by the use of metabolic inhibitors and nonfermentable artificial sweeteners in snacks, or the stimulation of saliva flow, could assist in the maintenance of homeostasis in plaque. Arguments will be presented that an appreciation of ecological principles will enable a more holistic approach to be taken in caries control.},

Calcium uptake or calcification of Streptococcus mutans C180-2, proven to be an acidogenic and cariogenic strain, was compared with calcium uptake and calcification of Corynebacterium (Bacterionema) matruchotii, known as a ready calcifier. Bacteria were grown on Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA) and on well-buffered semi-synthetic E-agar, both containing 1.4 mmol/L calcium, 2 g/L glucose, initial pH 7.4. Calcium uptake from BHIA by C. matruchotii (25 mmol Ca/kg wet bacterial cell mass), but not by S. mutans, was found. Grown as a plaque-like lawn on E-agar, the S. mutans cell mass concentrated calcium to 63 ± 11 mmol/ kg compared with 145 ± 61 mmol/kg in C. matruchotii. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of crystalline apatite in the bacterial cell masses. Electron microscopy revealed crystals and mineralized deposits in both organisms. Heavy calcifications in some cells of S. mutans were seen. Calcification was partly inhibited by magnesium ion and by methanehydroxybisphosphonate. S. sobrinus 6715, as well as freshly isolated S. mutans and S. sobrinus from patients, concentrated very large quantities of calcium, up to 500-fold from the medium, when maintained for several weeks on E-agar of initial pH 7.6. Our observations widen the view on acidogenic bacteria as mineralization agents and support the notion that members of the mutans group of streptococci may be involved in events that trigger heavy intracellular calcifications and, possibly, dental calculus formation.}

  abstract = {More than 1,000 different species of microbes have been found to live within the human oral cavity, where they play important roles in maintaining both oral and systemic health. Several studies have identified the core members of this microbial community; however, the factors that determine oral microbiome composition are not well understood. In this study, we exam the salivary oral microbiome of 1,049 Atlantic Canadians using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine which dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric features play a role in shaping microbial community composition. Features that were identified as being significantly associated with overall composition then were additionally examined for genera, amplicon sequence variants, and predicted pathway abundances that were associated with these features. Several associations were replicated in an additional secondary validation data set. Overall, we found that several anthropometric measurements, including waist-hip ratio (WHR), height, and fat-free mass, as well as age and sex, were associated with overall oral microbiome structure in both our exploratory and validation data sets. We were unable to validate any dietary impacts on overall taxonomic oral microbiome composition but did find evidence to suggest potential contributions from factors such as the number of vegetable and refined grain servings an individual consumes. Interestingly, each one of these factors on its own was associated with only minor shifts in the overall taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome, suggesting that future biomarker identification for several diseases associated with the oral microbiome can be undertaken without the worry of confounding factors obscuring biological signals. IMPORTANCE The human oral cavity is inhabited by a diverse community of microbes, known as the human oral microbiome. These microbes play a role in maintaining both oral and systemic health and, as such, have been proposed to be useful biomarkers of disease. However, to identify these biomarkers, we first need to determine the composition and variation of the healthy oral microbiome. In this report, we investigate the oral microbiome of 1,049 healthy individuals to determine which genera and amplicon sequence variants are commonly found between individual oral microbiomes. We then further investigate how lifestyle, anthropometric, and dietary choices impact overall microbiome composition. Interestingly, the results from this investigation showed that while many features were significantly associated with oral microbiome composition, no single biological factor explained a variation larger than 2\%. These results indicate that future work on biomarker detection may be encouraged by the lack of strong confounding factors.}

  abstract = {Relationships between geological phosphorite deposition and biological apatite nucleation have often been overlooked. However, similarities in biological apatite and phosphorite mineralogy suggest that their chemical formation mechanisms may be similar. This review serves to draw parallels between two newly described phosphorite mineralization processes, and proposes a similar novel mechanism for biologically controlled apatite mineral nucleation. This mechanism integrates polyphosphate biochemistry with crystal nucleation theory. Recently, the roles of polyphosphates in the nucleation of marine phosphorites were discovered. Marine bacteria and diatoms have been shown to store and concentrate inorganic phosphate (Pi) as amorphous, polyphosphate granules. Subsequent release of these P reserves into the local marine environment as Pi results in biologically induced phosphorite nucleation. Pi storage and release through an intracellular polyphosphate intermediate may also occur in mineralizing oral bacteria. Polyphosphates may be associated with biologically controlled apatite nucleation within vertebrates and invertebrates. Historically, biological apatite nucleation has been attributed to either a biochemical increase in local Pi concentration or matrix-mediated apatite nucleation control. This review proposes a mechanism that integrates both theories. Intracellular and extracellular amorphous granules, rich in both calcium and phosphorus, have been observed in apatite-biomineralizing vertebrates, protists, and atremate brachiopods. These granules may represent stores of calcium-polyphosphate. Not unlike phosphorite nucleation by bacteria and diatoms, polyphosphate depolymerization to Pi would be controlled by phosphatase activity. Enzymatic polyphosphate depolymerization would increase apatite saturation to the level required for mineral nucleation, while matrix proteins would simultaneously control the progression of new biological apatite formation.},

Recent research has targeted the plant microremains preserved in this mineralised deposit as a source of dietary and health information for recent and past populations.

Few studies to date have directly compared the microremain record from dental calculus to dietary records, and none with long-term observation dietary records, thus limiting how we can interpret diet, food acquisition and behaviour. Here we present a high-resolution analysis of calculus microremains from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We test microremain assemblages against more than two decades of field behavioural observations to establish the ability of calculus to capture the composition of diet. Our results show that some microremain classes accumulate as long-lived dietary markers. Phytolith abundance in calculus can reflect the proportions of plants in the diet, yet this pattern is not true for starches. We also report microremains can record information about other dietary behaviours, such as the age of weaning and learned food processing techniques like nut-cracking.},

  abstract = {The study of ancient human dental calculus (mineralized dental plaque, also known as tartar) is becoming increasingly important in osteoarchaeology, human palaeoecology and environmental archaeology. Microremains of different origin (e.g. starch granules, pollen, phytoliths, feather barbules) as well as biomolecules and chemical compounds retrieved from its mineral matrix may represent an important link between past humans and their physical, biological and social environment, but they are rarely fully linked to the evidence from skeletal remains. This paper critically reviews the lines of evidence retrieved from dental calculus in relation to osteoarchaeological parameters, employing macroscopic, microscopic and biomolecular approaches, assessing synergy potential and limitations. The scope of this paper is also to contribute to the building of a much needed theoretical framework in this emerging subfield.},

With its current release (07/2021) the database offers information for 82 892 bacterial and archaeal strains covering taxonomy, morphology, cultivation, metabolism, origin, and sequence information within 1048 data fields. By integrating high-quality data from additional culture collections as well as detailed information from species descriptions, the amount of data provided has increased by 30\% over the past three years. A newly developed query builder tool in the advanced search now allows complex database queries. Thereby bacterial strains can be systematically searched based on combinations of their attributes, e.g. growth and metabolic features for biotechnological applications or to identify gaps in the present knowledge about bacteria. A new interactive dashboard provides a statistic overview over the most important data fields. Additional new features are improved genomic sequence data, integrated NCBI TaxIDs and links to BacMedia, the new sister database on cultivation media. To improve the findability and interpretation of data through search engines, data in BacDive are annotated with bioschemas.org terms.}

  abstract = {The attachment of dental calculus to the tooth (enamel or cementum) surface affects the ease or difficulty of its removal. Understanding the ultrastructural features of the calculus–tooth interface will help in the development of efficient strategies for efficient removal of dental calculus. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the ultrastructural characteristics of the calculus–tooth interface in relation to the occurrence of calculus fracture. Design: Investigation of the ultrastructural characteristics of the calculus–tooth interface was made on eight human molars with mature supragingival and subgingival calculus using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Results: Fractures were shown by SEM to consistently occur within the calculus itself, but not at the calculus–tooth interface. Higher magnification revealed that the enamel apatite crystals (in the case of supragingival calculus) or the cementum apatite crystals (in the case of subgingival calculus) appeared intimately connected with the calculus crystals at the calculus–enamel or calculus–cementum interface. TEM micrographs confirmed this intimate direct connection or fusion (epitaxial growth) of calculus crystals with enamel and cementum apatite crystals. FT-IR showed lower concentrations of organic phase attributed to microorganisms and higher concentrations of collagen at the calculus–cementum interface compared to that in the calculus away from the interface. Conclusion: Difficulty in complete calculus removal from tooth surfaces (especially from cementum or dentin) may be due in part to the intimate contact between the calculus and the tooth, due to the chemical bonding between the calculus crystals and the tooth apatite crystals and occasional fusion (i.e., epitaxial growth) of the calculus calcium phosphate crystals with the enamel, dentin or apatite crystals. This cohesive bonding results in fracture planes occurring within the calculus instead of at the calculus–tooth interface.},

  abstract = {More than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the human oral cavity. They form highly organized microbial communities and are responsible for many oral infectious diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. The prevention and treatment of these diseases require a comprehensive knowledge of oral microbial communities, which largely relies on culture-dependent methods to provide detailed phenotypic and physiological analysis of these communities. However, most of the currently available laboratory media can only selectively support the growth of a limited number of bacterial species within these communities, and fail to sustain the original oral microbial diversity. In this study, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as an index to systematically survey and analyse the selectivity of commonly used laboratory media, we developed a new medium (SHI medium) by combining the ingredients of several selected media that can support different subpopulations within the original oral microbial community derived from pooled saliva. DGGE and 454 pyrosequencing analysis showed that SHI medium was capable of supporting a more diversified community with a microbial profile closer to that of the original oral microbiota. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing revealed that SHI medium supported the growth of many oral species that have not before been cultured. Crystal violet assay and the confocal laser scanning microscope analysis indicated that, compared with other media, SHI medium is able to support a more complex saliva-derived biofilm with higher biomass yield and more diverse species. This DGGE-guided method could also be used to develop novel media for other complex microbial communities.},

Dental calculus is a mineralised biofilm that forms on the surface of teeth, with the potential to encase anything that comes into contact with the mouth. Dental calculus has provided information on the lifeways of past people including diet, health, disease, trade and fabrication. To extract this microarchaeological information from dental calculus it must first be processed, either mechanically (with a mortar and pestle) or chemically (generally with hydrochloric acid or HCl), in order to free the microparticles and biomolecular structures encased within. Until now, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has not been used for microparticle extraction. Here we present data that demonstrate EDTA is an equally and potentially more effective decalcifying agent for extracting microparticles than previous methods using samples from the Southwest Pacific and Ireland. EDTA has the added benefit of being an appropriate for the first step in genomic and proteomic sample processing.},

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 LAP patients, 15 healthy siblings (HS), and 13 unrelated healthy controls (HC) were stimulated with: LPS, lipoteichoic acid, or peptidoglycan; intact or sonically dispersed in vitro–grown biofilms from a LAP disease site, a LAP healthy site, or a healthy control site.

Qualitative differences in the cytokine response pattern among patient groups were observed to intact and dispersed biofilms, yet responses to healthy and diseased biofilms could not be discriminated. Despite an equivalent magnitude of response, LAP-derived PBMCs demonstrated a qualitatively different pattern of response to LPS and dispersed biofilms. PMBCs from each group responded distinctly to stimulation withsubgingival biofilms. Multiple underlying mechanisms related to bacterial-induced inflammatory responses can culminate in LAP disease initiation and/or progression, and biofilm homeostasis could play an important role.},

  abstract = {Background: Dental calculus, calcified oral plaque biofilm, contains microbial and host biomolecules that can be used to study historic microbiome communities and host responses. Dental calculus does not typically accumulate as much today as historically, and clinical oral microbiome research studies focus primarily on living dental plaque biofilm. However, plaque and calculus reflect different conditions of the oral biofilm, and the differences in microbial characteristics between the sample types have not yet been systematically explored. Here, we compare the microbial profiles of modern dental plaque, modern dental calculus, and historic dental calculus to establish expected differences between these substrates. Results: Metagenomic data was generated from modern and historic calculus samples, and dental plaque metagenomic data was downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project. Microbial composition and functional profile were assessed. Metaproteomic data was obtained from a subset of historic calculus samples. Comparisons between microbial, protein, and metabolomic profiles revealed distinct taxonomic and metabolic functional profiles between plaque, modern calculus, and historic calculus, but not between calculus collected from healthy teeth and periodontal disease-affected teeth. Species co-exclusion was related to biofilm environment. Proteomic profiling revealed that healthy tooth samples contain low levels of bacterial virulence proteins and a robust innate immune response. Correlations between proteomic and metabolomic profiles suggest co-preservation of bacterial lipid membranes and membrane-associated proteins. Conclusions: Overall, we find that there are systematic microbial differences between plaque and calculus related to biofilm physiology, and recognizing these differences is important for accurate data interpretation in studies comparing dental plaque and calculus.},

Modern investigations of native human microbiota have demonstrated that the human microbiome plays a central role in health and chronic disease, raising questions about changes in microbial ecology, diversity and function through time. This paper explores the current state of ancient oral microbiome research and discusses successful applications, methodological challenges and future possibilities in elucidating the intimate evolutionary relationship between humans and their microbes.},

We report the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution taxonomic and protein functional characterization of the ancient oral microbiome and demonstrate that the oral cavity has long served as a reservoir for bacteria implicated in both local and systemic disease. We characterize (i) the ancient oral microbiome in a diseased state, (ii) 40 opportunistic pathogens, (iii) ancient human-associated putative antibiotic resistance genes, (iv) a genome reconstruction of the periodontal pathogen Tannerella forsythia, (v) 239 bacterial and 43 human proteins, allowing confirmation of a long-term association between host immune factors, 'red complex' pathogens and periodontal disease, and (vi) DNA sequences matching dietary sources. Directly datable and nearly ubiquitous, dental calculus permits the simultaneous investigation of pathogen activity, host immunity and diet, thereby extending direct investigation of common diseases into the human evolutionary past.},

  abstract = {The objectives were to develop and characterize a procedure based on a ureolytic pH rise to deposit calcium phosphate into microcosm dental plaque biofilms and to test the importance of the plaque pH range. Plaque biofilms were cultured in a multiplaque culture system (‘artificial mouth’) with a continuous supply of a simulated oral fluid (basal medium mucin; BMM) with 146mmol/l (5\% w/v) sucrose periodically applied over 6min every 8h. After initial plaque growth, the biofilms were periodically exposed for up to 16 days to 6-min applications of calcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing 20mmol/l CaCl2, 12mmol/l NaH2PO4, 5mmol/l monofluorophosphate and 500mmol/l urea (pH 5.0). Three application regimes were examined, one included a sucrose-induced acidic pH fluctuation. Plaque hydrolysis of the urea in CPMU caused the pH to rise to between 8.2 and 8.8, depositing fluoridated and carbonated calcium phosphates, and possibly some calcium carbonate, into the plaque. Calcium, phosphate and fluoride deposition was rapid for about 4 days and then slowed. After 10 days’ treatment under standard conditions (BMM containing 1mmol/l urea and 1mmol/l arginine), plaque calcium and phosphate concentrations had increased up to 50-fold and 10-fold to approximately 2–4 and 1–2mmol/g plaque protein, respectively. The calcium, phosphate and fluoride content increased steadily. Calcium phosphate deposition was proportional to the plaque resting pH, increasing over four-fold when the BMM urea concentration was increased from 0 to 20mmol/l, which raised the resting pH from 6.4 to 7.2 and yielded a mean plaque calcium concentration of 14.3mmol/g protein, one subsample reaching 20.8mmol/g protein. Supplementation of BMM with 20\% human serum inhibited deposition. These results support the hypothesis that an alkaline pH in plaque is critical in promoting plaque mineralization and that mineral deposition is modulated by serum. These factors are likely to be important in regulating calculus formation.},

  abstract = {The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health, and disease, but little is known about the global diversity, variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting that they have been important oral members since before the catarrhine–platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100 thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial coadaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic modern humans that is not observed in later modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal framework for understanding microbial health and disease.},

Biofilm was collected from two aerobic heterotrophic biofilm reactors, which were seeded with Sphingomonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. plus mixed liquor, respectively, and operated under toxic organic (in this case, azo dye) degrading conditions. Complete mixing conditions in the two reactors were verified by measuring water content, and polysaccharide and protein quantities from three vertical sampling positions over time. Experimental results showed that: (1) the biofilm water content of either reactor did not change with sample position or biofilm age, with an average biofilm water content m both reactors of 97\%; (2) polysaccharides and proteins in the ECPs did not change with sample position; (3) the profiles of polysaccharides and proteins along the biofilm depth showed a stratified biofilm structure, with their ratio (proteins/polysaccharides) being relatively stable over the depth. Oxygen and substrate transport and interactions among species were considered to be the main reasons for producing such a non-uniform biofilm structure; and (4) Sphingomonas sp. could not compete well with microorganisms derived from the mixed liquor of a wastewater treatment plant aeration basin.},
