Dental calculus...

<!-- In more recent years, the study of dental calculus has increased exponentially, 
and the wealth of information contained within the mineralised matrix has been, 
to a larger extent, acknowledged; the benefits of which span a wide variety of
archaeological research areas, such as oral microbiome 
characterisation (including pathogens) through the analysis of DNA and proteins 
[@adlerSequencingAncientCalcified2013; @warinnerPathogensHostImmunity2014],
microbotanical remains [@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009;
@mickleburghNewInsightsConsumption2012], 
other organic residues from dietary compounds [@buckleyDentalCalculusCooking2014], 
and nicotine-use [@eerkensDentalCalculusSource2018]. -->

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->

Shortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), the salivary
pellicle attaches to the teeth. The salivary pellicle is comprised of ... 
and provides a viable surface for bacterial attachment, prompting early coloniser
species, such as *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces* spp., to adhere to the tooth.
