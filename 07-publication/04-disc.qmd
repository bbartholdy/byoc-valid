<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->
In this study we present a calcifying oral biofilm model
to produce artificial dental calculus. Our proposed use of the model is to address
a variety of research questions related to dietary information extracted from
dental calculus, in both modern and archaeological samples.
For that to be feasible, the model needs to serve as a viable proxy to
dental calculus grown under natural conditions, i.e., in the human oral cavity.
It needs, as much as possible, to mimic the diversity and complexity of the
natural oral microbiome, while also offering control over factors such as dietary
input, growth conditions, and replicability within and between experiments.
Here, we assessed the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus
using metagenomic classification and FTIR analysis to explore the bacterial
and mineral composition, and compare with oral reference samples.

## Microbiome

<!--needs a more positive tone-->
<!-- diversity and complexity within experiment and compared to oral references -->
There is a loss of diversity from inocula saliva to model calculus, and
when compared to oral reference samples, which is a common limitation in
biofilm models [@edlundBiofilmModel2013; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013].
The donated saliva for the experiment
had a lower diversity than the reference saliva samples, and may have contributed
to a lower diversity in experimental samples. Consequently, there is also
a lower diversity and richness when compared to other modern oral reference samples,
including oral mucosa, saliva, plaque, and calculus.
Samples of the medium from early in the experiment have similar species profiles
to the donated saliva, but gradually diverge over the course of the experiment.
This may be caused by experimental setup not sufficiently mimicking the oral
environment, allowing different species
to thrive that do not normally thrive in the natural oral environment.
<!-- more about within-experiment results? -->
<!-- community profiles compared to oral references -->

Model calculus has a lower alpha-diversity than modern reference calculus and
other oral reference samples, and clusters separately in the sPCA analysis. 
Species within the genera *Veillonella* and *Enterococcus* are the most 
abundant in model calculus samples, followed by *Streptococcus* and *Prevotella*.
Oral reference samples have a relative abundance of streptococci similar
to our model, but a more diverse representation from other genera such as
*Actinomyces*, *Capnocytophaga*, and *Fusobacterium*.
Especially *Enterococcus* spp. seemed to thrive later in the experiment, at the
expense of fastidious early coloniser species like *Capnocytophaga* and *Neisseria*
spp., which require an environment with at least 5% carbon dioxide to thrive
[@tonjumNeisseria2017]. Our biofilm was grown under atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels outside of our control.
While *Enterococcus* spp. were present (in low quantities) in donor saliva, they
are also known environmental contaminants, and we cannot
exclude environmental contamination as a possible source for these species in our
model.<!-- plot mean count of E. spp. over course of experiment-->
The separation of model calculus from other oral reference samples may also be
caused by a loss of diversity in aerotolerance. Of the dominant species in the
model, most are either anaerobes or facultative anaerobes, predominantly
Gram-negative *Veillonella* and *Prevotella*, and Gram-positive *Enterococcus*.
Species within predominantly aerobic genera, such as *Neisseria*, *Rothia*, and
*Ottowia*, are deficient in the model compared to the donated saliva
and other oral samples, suggesting a shift from a largely
aerotolerant profile to an anaerobic profile during the experiment.<!-- Discuss the stable vs shaken oxygenation levels of media - the level of shaking that you used are too low to maintain atmospheric oxygen levels?-->
While our model is not set up as an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to
have outcompeted aerobes and, to some extent, facultative anaerobes.
This is likely a result of communities of bacteria within the biofilm creating
favourable microenvironments facilitated by the protective properties of the
biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016; @edlundUncoveringComplex2018].
*Capnocytophaga* and *Actinomyces* spp. are predominantly (facultative) anaerobes,
so their deficiency may be attributed to, for example, nutrient availability or
being out-competed by other species.

Overall, the main causes of separation seem to be the abundance of (facultative)
anaerobes
in the model compared to reference calculus, and the overgrowth of *Enterococcus*
spp. *E. faecalis*, *E. durans*, and *E. casseliflavus*.
This may be due to human variation, as there can be large differences
in the oral microbiome of two individuals at the species level due to variations
in age, sex, and
other demographic factors, as well as how and when saliva samples were collected
[@burchamPatternsOral2020; @nearingAssessingVariation2020].
It may also be a problem in oral biofilm models in general, as the reference
*in vitro* samples also have a high abundance of *Enterococcus* spp.
Whether or not distinct microbial profiles, and the extracellular matrix
they produce, will affect the retention of
dietary particles in plaque remains to be seen, and likely depends on the role
bacteria and the matrix play in the incorporation and retention of dietary
compounds and microremains within a biofilm. Samples within the experiment were
quite consistent in terms of bacterial composition, making it possible for future
studies to explore the role of bacteria in starch retention.
Overall the majority of model calculus samples
contained a distinctly oral signature, providing a promising starting point for
the use of the model as a viable proxy to dental calculus.

## Mineralisation

FTIR analysis allowed us to address the mineralisation process of the model.
The results showed an increasing mineral composition over the course of the
experiment as the model biofilm matured.
Samples taken early in the experiment, on day 7 and 12, had a high lipid and
protein content consistent with the presence of bacterial cells and
a matrix of extracellular polysaccharides [@jainIsolationCharacterization2013].
The high water content, indicated by
the O--H stretch, is also consistent with the high water content (up to 97%)
of a biofilm matrix [@sutherlandBiofilmMatrix2001; @zhangMeasurementPolysaccharides1998].
As the samples mature over the course of the experiment, the ratio of proteins
and lipids to phosphates shifts from predominantly organic content to
predominantly inorganic content in the form of carbonated hydroxyapatite.

The artificial samples from day 24 are consistent with spectra of carbonated
hydroxyapatite and protein, and resemble both the modern reference calculus and
the archaeological calculus in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper
slope in the grind curve plots of the archaeological sample may suggest that the
crystals in archaeological samples are larger, and hence more ordered than in the
model calculus. A possible explanation is that
the inorganic crystals within archaeological calculus have had more time to grow
into the space left by degraded organic matter [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010].
It should be noted that only one archaeological sample was analysed here, and
further analyses are necessary to estimate variance between samples.
The short duration of model
calculus growth over 24 days may also have affected the results, compared to 
longer-term *in vivo*.
The constant disruptions in growth of *in vivo* dental plaque/calculus, due to
oral hygiene and other external pressures on biofilm growth, will lead to
multiple stages of calcium phosphates, whereas our model has more stable
growth conditions.

One of the most well-known biomineralisers, *Corynebacterium matruchotii*
[@enneverCharacterizationBacterionema1978; @takazoeCalciumHydroxyapatite1970],
exhibited a lower abundance in our model calculus compared to modern
reference calculus. However, the mineral composition of the end results were similar,
reinforcing the idea that, under the right circumstances, biofilms with a range
of microbial profiles can facilitate mineralisation
[@moorerCalcificationCariogenic1993].
Bacteria and their ability to secrete an extracellular matrix are integral in the
formation of dental calculus, and inevitably serve as part of the structure that
dental calculus is built upon [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005], while the
exact species composition of the biofilm communities may be less important.

## Replicability

Model calculus displayed similar species diversity and microbial profiles
across all samples, indicating a high level of replicability between samples
in the experimental run.
It remains to be seen whether the replicability within the experiment
also scales up to between-experiment replicability in our model, though others
have shown that replicability in long-term models is possible when using the
same inocula [@velskoConsistentReproducible2018].
The variation in mineral composition was initially high in early model biofilm
samples, but model calculus samples from day 24
were largely similar in composition as observed in the FTIR spectra.
The use of a simple multiwell plate setup allows us to submit many samples
to the same conditions, increasing replicability between samples [@extercateAAA2010].
While the experimental conditions, including the dietary input, are kept constant,
and the mineral and bacterial profiles are similar between samples, there is
still a relatively large variation in starch retention in the model calculus
[@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].

## Limitations

While our in vitro model calculus system provides reproducible and consistent
artificial dental calculus for archaeological research, as demonstrated by the
species composition and the mineralisation properties, we recognise the model
has several limitations.
Our single-donor approach may have affected the diversity of the model. The donated
saliva from our study had a lower mean Shannon Index than other saliva samples.
The lower diversity may be caused by only using one donor instead of pooling saliva
from multiple individuals. However, having a single inoculum donor allows us to maintain
the integrity of a native oral microbiome which may be lost when samples
are pooled [@edlundBiofilmModel2013]. 
It is also possible that the diversity was affected
by the collection and storage methods we used. This has been shown to have
minimal effect on microbial profiles at the genus level [@limSalivaMicrobiome2017],
but some effect on beta diversity calculations [@omoriComparativeEvaluation2021].  

Some samples were grown with starch-sucrose solutions as nutrients, while controls
were grown with sucrose only. Due to the financial cost, we did not sequence enough
samples of each nutrient treatment to assess the influence of starch on the microbial
community or mineral composition.
Biofilms were grown in a standard shaking bacterial growth incubator, rather than
an incubator specific to cell cultures. The lack of complex environmental control
may cause the model to deviate from its natural growth over the 24 days that the
experiment is run, due to a lack of precise control over conditions such as
pH and salivary flow rates.

There is also the possibility that contamination was introduced into the model during
the experiment. While the CPMU solution was
prepared under sterile conditions, the solution itself was not autoclaved or
filter-sterilised. In the species composition metagenomic analysis, all
medium samples collected after the introduction of CPMU on day 14 were removed by the
authentication step because the majority of species appeared to derive from
environmental sources indicating external contamination.
Going forward we recommend filter-sterilising solutions that are not autoclaved.  

To avoid disturbing the growth and development of our biofilm, we took
samples of media from the bottom of the wells after three days without full media
replacement, careful not to disturb other plate-bound biofilms.
The samples may therefore not fully reflect the composition of the biofilm itself.
Going forward we recommend sampling from the actual biofilm, as this is
the sample type under investigation.  

<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->

## Future work

Our goals for additional validation measures involve functional profiles of bacteria,
to see if metabolic behaviour
of bacteria is consistent with *in vivo* conditions, and whether this is
affected by the presence/absence of amylase and starch treatments.
The absence of host salivary $\alpha$-amylase activity in our model
(as shown in @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022) provides
an opportunity to explore the effect of various amylase levels on biofilm growth
and composition, as well as the incorporation
of dietary compounds, especially starches, in dental calculus.
Further protocol optimisation will also be necessary to address some of the
limitations of our current model, such as reducing the frequency of
medium replacement (currently every three days) to help promote the
growth of slow-growing fastidious organisms and limit generalists such as enterococci,
and supplementing it with serum to provide additional nutrients and biofilm
stability [@tianUsingDGGE2010; @ammannZurichBiofilm2012].
More infrequent medium replacement would facilitate slow-growing bacteria in
establishing their metabolic relationships, allowing the byproducts of some species
to become abundant enough for others that depend on these to grow [@marshDentalPlaque2005].  
An important question to address is what role bacteria play in the incorporation
and retention of dietary microremains, and whether differing bacterial profiles
affect the dietary incorporation and retention within the biofilm.  
The model can also be used to explore limitations and biases of methods used to
reconstruct past dietary patterns from dental calculus. To this end,
sucrose and raw starch treatments can be replaced with other dietary components
of interest, such as cooked starches, whole plant extracts, and various proteins.

# Conclusions

The bacterial profile of our model calculus is not an exact match to the natural
modern or archaeological reference calculus, but species richness and diversity
falls within a similar range as the reference *in vitro* model, and the core genera
are predominantly oral.
Our model calculus had a distinct microbial profile from modern reference calculus,
but a similar mineral composition to modern and archaeological reference calculus,
consisting of carbonate hydroxyapatite and similar levels of crystallinity and
order, with a slightly higher organic phase.<!-- rephrase -->

Our model has many potential benefits within archaeological
research, especially since the setup does not require highly specialised equipment,
making it accessible to many labs within the archaeological sciences.
It can be used to test many fundamental aspects of
the process of incorporation, retention, and subsequent extraction of various dietary
components from archaeological dental calculus.
Using an oral biofilm model in a controlled environment with known dietary input,
we can learn more about how different methods of food processing in the past
may affect results of dental calculus analyses, and how the methods we use
may further distort this picture. Our method can be used to test methods
(e.g. DNA, proteomics, etc.), decontamination protocols, as well as training on
these methods and protocols without depleting limited archaeological resources.
The purpose of our model is not to replace studies conducted on archaeological
and natural dental calculus, rather balance limitations of each method and serve as
a complementary approach to expand our toolkit.
<!-- ultimately we are left with more questions than answers, but isn't that the 
beauty of science? -->
