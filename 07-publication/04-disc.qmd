<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->
In this study we present a calcifying oral biofilm model
to produce artificial dental calculus. Our proposed use of the model is to address
a variety of research questions related to dietary information extracted from
dental calculus, in both modern and archaeological samples.
For that to be feasible, the model needs to serve as a viable proxy to
dental calculus grown under natural conditions, i.e., in the human oral cavity.
It needs, as much as possible, to mimic the diversity and complexity of the
natural oral microbiome, while also offering control over factors such as dietary
input, growth conditions, and replicability within and between experiments.
Here, we assessed the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus
using metagenomic classification and FTIR analysis to explore the bacterial
and mineral composition, and compare with oral reference samples.

### Microbiome

<!-- diversity and complexity within experiment and compared to oral references -->
Model calculus has lower species diversity than inocula saliva and oral reference
samples, which is a common limitation in biofilm models
[@edlundBiofilmModel2013; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013]. The donated saliva for the
experiment had a lower diversity than the reference saliva samples, and may have
contributed to a lower diversity in experimental samples. Consequently, there is
also a lower diversity and richness when compared to other modern oral reference
samples, including oral mucosa, saliva, plaque, and calculus.
Samples of the medium from early in the experiment have similar species profiles
to the donated saliva, but gradually diverge over the course of the experiment.
This may be caused by experimental setup not sufficiently mimicking the oral
environment, allowing species
to thrive that do not normally thrive in the natural oral environment.

Oral reference samples have a relative abundance of streptococci similar
to our model, but a more diverse representation from other genera and an overall
higher species diversity and richness than our model.
Reference samples also had a more diverse aerotolerance profile than our model,
which primarily consisted of (faculatative) anaerobes. Species within
predominantly aerobic genera, are deficient in the model, suggesting a shift from a
largely aerotolerant profile to an anaerobic profile during the experiment.
While our model is not set up as an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to
have outcompeted aerobes and, to some extent, facultative anaerobes.
This is likely a result of communities of bacteria within the biofilm creating
favourable microenvironments facilitated by the protective properties of the
biofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016; @edlundUncoveringComplex2018].

Overall, the majority of model calculus samples contained a distinctly oral
signature, providing a promising starting point for the use of the model as a
viable proxy to dental calculus. The main differences between model and oral
reference samples may be due to human variation, as there can be large differences
in the oral microbiome of two individuals at the species level due to variations
in age, sex, and other demographic factors, as well as how and when saliva samples
were collected [@burchamPatternsOral2020; @nearingAssessingVariation2020].
Whether or not distinct microbial profiles, and the extracellular matrix
they produce, will affect the retention of dietary particles in plaque remains to
be seen, but is an important question to address in the future. 

### Mineralisation

FTIR analysis allowed us to address the mineralisation process of the model,
which showed an increasing mineral composition over the course of the
experiment. As the model biofilm matured, the predominantly organic content of
early samples was replaced by inorganic content in the form of carbonated
hydroxyapatite, consistent with a shift from a high presence of bacterial cells
in a matrix of extracellular polysaccharides
[@jainIsolationCharacterization2013; @sutherlandBiofilmMatrix2001; @zhangMeasurementPolysaccharides1998]
to a predominantly mineral content.

The model calculus samples resemble both the modern reference calculus and
the archaeological calculus in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper
slope in the grind curve plots of the archaeological sample suggests that the
crystals in archaeological samples are larger, and hence more ordered than in
model calculus. A possible explanation is that
the inorganic crystals within archaeological calculus have had more time to grow
into the space left by degraded organic matter [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010];
however, we only analysed one archaeological sample and cannot definitively
address this. The short duration of model calculus growth may also have affected
the results, compared to the longer-term growth and mineralisation of natural calculus.
The constant disruptions in growth of *in vivo* dental plaque/calculus, due to
oral hygiene and other external pressures on biofilm growth, may lead to
multiple stages of calcium phosphates, whereas our model has more stable
growth conditions.

One of the most well-known biomineralisers, *Corynebacterium matruchotii*
[@enneverCharacterizationBacterionema1978; @takazoeCalciumHydroxyapatite1970],
exhibited a lower abundance in our model calculus compared to modern
reference calculus. However, the mineral composition of the end results were similar,
reinforcing the idea that, under the right circumstances, biofilms with a range
of microbial profiles can facilitate mineralisation
[@moorerCalcificationCariogenic1993].
Bacteria and their ability to secrete an extracellular matrix are integral in the
formation of dental calculus, and inevitably serve as part of the structure that
dental calculus is built upon [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005], while the
exact species composition of the biofilm communities may be less important.

### Replicability

Model calculus displayed similar species diversity and microbial profiles
across all samples, indicating a high level of replicability between samples
in the experimental run.
It remains to be seen whether the replicability within the experiment
also scales up to between-experiment replicability in our model, though others
have already shown that replicability in long-term models is possible when using
the same inocula [@velskoConsistentReproducible2018].
The variation in mineral composition in our model was initially high, but samples
from day 24 were largely similar in composition as observed in the FTIR spectra.
The use of a simple multiwell plate setup allows us to submit many samples
to the same conditions, increasing replicability between samples [@extercateAAA2010].

### Limitations

While our in vitro model calculus system provides reproducible and consistent
artificial dental calculus for archaeological research, as demonstrated by the
species composition and the mineralisation properties, we recognise the model
has several limitations.
Our single-donor approach may have affected the diversity of the model. The donated
saliva from our study had a lower mean Shannon Index than other saliva samples.
The lower diversity may be caused by only using one donor instead of pooling saliva
from multiple individuals. However, having a single inoculum donor allows us to maintain
the integrity of a native oral microbiome which may be lost when samples
are pooled [@edlundBiofilmModel2013]. 
It is also possible that the diversity was affected
by the collection and storage methods we used. This has been shown to have
minimal effect on microbial profiles at the genus level [@limSalivaMicrobiome2017],
but some effect on beta diversity calculations [@omoriComparativeEvaluation2021].  

Some samples were grown with starch-sucrose solutions as nutrients, while controls
were grown with sucrose only. Due to the financial cost, we did not sequence enough
samples of each nutrient treatment to assess the influence of starch on the microbial
community or mineral composition.
Biofilms were grown in a standard shaking bacterial growth incubator, rather than
an incubator specific to cell cultures. The lack of complex environmental control
may cause the model to deviate from its natural growth over the 25 days that the
experiment is run, due to a lack of precise control over conditions such as
pH and salivary flow rates.

There is also the possibility that contamination was introduced into the model during
the experiment. While the CPMU solution was
prepared under sterile conditions, the solution itself was not autoclaved or
filter-sterilised. In the species composition metagenomic analysis, all
medium samples collected after the introduction of CPMU on day 14 were removed by the
authentication step because the majority of species appeared to derive from
environmental sources indicating external contamination.
Going forward we recommend filter-sterilising solutions that are not autoclaved.  

To avoid disturbing the growth and development of our biofilm, we took
samples of media from the bottom of the wells after three days without full media
replacement, careful not to disturb other plate-bound biofilms.
The samples may therefore not fully reflect the composition of the biofilm itself.
Going forward we recommend sampling from the actual biofilm, as this is
the sample type under investigation.  

<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->

### Future work

Further protocol optimisation will also be necessary to address some of the
limitations of our current model, such as reducing the frequency of
medium replacement (currently every three days) to help promote the
growth of slow-growing fastidious organisms and limit generalists such as enterococci,
and supplementing it with serum to provide additional nutrients and biofilm
stability [@tianUsingDGGE2010; @ammannZurichBiofilm2012].
More infrequent medium replacement would facilitate slow-growing bacteria in
establishing their metabolic relationships, allowing the byproducts of some species
to become abundant enough for others that depend on these to grow [@marshDentalPlaque2005].  

Our goals for additional validation measures involve functional profiles of bacteria,
to see if metabolic behaviour of bacteria is consistent with *in vivo* conditions,
and whether this is affected by the presence/absence of amylase and starch treatments.
The absence of host salivary $\alpha$-amylase activity in our model
(as shown in @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022) provides
an opportunity to explore the effect of various amylase levels on biofilm growth
and composition, as well as the incorporation of dietary compounds in dental calculus.

The model can also be used to explore limitations and biases of methods used to
reconstruct past dietary patterns from dental calculus. To this end,
sucrose and raw starch treatments can be replaced with other dietary components
of interest, such as cooked starches, whole plant extracts, and various proteins.

## Conclusions

The bacterial profile of our model calculus is not an exact match to the natural
modern or archaeological reference calculus, but species richness and diversity
falls within a similar range as the reference *in vitro* model, and the core genera
are predominantly oral.
Our model calculus had a distinct microbial profile from modern reference calculus,
but a similar mineral composition to modern and archaeological reference calculus,
consisting of carbonate hydroxyapatite and similar levels of crystallinity and
order, with a slightly higher organic phase.<!-- rephrase -->

Our model has many potential benefits within archaeological
research, especially since the setup does not require highly specialised equipment,
making it accessible to many labs within the archaeological sciences.
It can be used to test many fundamental aspects of
the process of incorporation, retention, and subsequent extraction of various dietary
components from archaeological dental calculus.
Using an oral biofilm model in a controlled environment with known dietary input,
we can learn more about how different methods of food processing in the past
may affect results of dental calculus analyses, and how the methods we use
may further distort this picture. Our method can be used to test methods
(e.g. DNA, proteomics, etc.), decontamination protocols, as well as training on
these methods and protocols without depleting limited archaeological resources.
The purpose of our model is not to replace studies conducted on archaeological
and natural dental calculus, but rather to balance limitations of each method
and serve as a complementary approach to expand our toolkit.
<!-- ultimately we are left with more questions than answers, but isn't that the 
beauty of science? -->
